A fuel cell hybrid electric vehicle (FC-HEV) with the fuel cell/battery hybrid powertrain is used as the study case. The battery plays a key role in current transportation electrification, and the optimal sizing of the battery is critical for both system technical performances and economical revenues, especially in the hybrid design. The optimal battery design should coordinate the static sizing study against the dynamic power distribution for a given system, but few works provided the synergistic consideration of the two parts. In this study, the interaction happens in each sizing point with the optimal power sharing between the battery and the FC, aiming at minimizing the summation of hydrogen consumption, FC degradation and battery degradation. Under the proposed framework, the power management is developed with deep Q network (DQN) algorithm, considering multi-objectives that minimizing hydrogen consumption and suppressing system degradation. In the case study, optimal sizing parameters with lowest cost are determined. Leveraged by the optimal size, the hybrid system economy with synergistic approach is improved by 16.0%, comparing with the conventional FC configuration.","School of Computing, Electronics and Maths"

This paper introduces a novel semi-supervised image segmentation method for satellite image segmentation. Unlike the semantic segmentation strategies, this method requires only limited labelled data from small local patches of satellite images. Due to the complexity and large number of land cover objects in satellite images, a fixed-size square window is used for feature extraction from 7 different local areas. The local features are extracted by spectral domain analysis. Then, classification is performed based on similarity of the local features to those of the,7 labelled patches. This also allows efficient selection of the suitable window scale. Furthermore, the labeled features remove the need for iterative clustering for decision making about features. The labelled data also allows learning a subspace of transformed features for segmentation of water and green area based on simple thresholding. Comparison of the segmentation results using the,proposed strategy compared to unsupervised techniques such as k-means clustering and Superpixel-based Fast Fuzzy C-Means Clustering (SFFCM) shows the superiority of the proposed strategy in terms of content-based segmentation.","School of Computing, Electronics and Maths"

Arvanitakis,A critical comparison on attitude estimation: From gaussian approximate filters to coordinate-free dual optimal control,"This paper conveys attitude and rate estimation without rate sensors by performing a critical comparison, validated by extensive simulations. The two dominant approaches to facilitate attitude estimation are based on stochastic and set-membership reasoning. The first one mostly utilizes the commonly known Gaussian-approximate filters, namely the EKF and UKF. Although more conservative, the latter seems to be more promising as it considers the inherent geometric characteristics of the underline compact state space and accounts—from first principles—for large model errors. The set-theoretic approach from a control point of view is addressed, and it is shown that it can overcome reported deficiencies of the Bayesian architectures related to this problem, leading to coordinate-free optimal filters. Lastly, as an example, a modified predictive filter is derived on the tangent bundle of the special orthogonal group (Formula presented.).","School of Computing, Electronics and Maths"

Machine learning algorithms have been used as a tool to predict and diagnose diseases. Some of these algorithms got the popularity due to their high recognition performance. In the recognition of PD, studies demonstrated various recognition performances and this systematic review study the performance of machine learning algorithms. This systematic review is based on the cochrane’s proposed seven phases of review. After identifying the question of research and inclusion/exclusion criteria, we searched different related databases (SID, MagIran, PubMed, ProQuest, ScienceDirect, WoS, Scopus, and Google Scholar) with the help of combination of keywords. After selection of the studies we extract information and summarize the results. From 10,980 found-studies, and removing them based on inclusion/exclustion criteria, we selected 82 studies. To diagnose PD, 59 studies used clinical indicators, 2 studies used genetic characteristics, 12 used MRI, two used PET, 5 used SPECT and 2 used Laboratory markers. In most of these studies RF, SVM, LR have performed the best. The accuracies of RF, SVM, and LR are reported between 58.9%-99.42%, 65.2%-99.99%, and 43.9%-96%. The results show that the performance of RF, SVM, and LR are high for PD diagnosis.

These are per-sample random AP selection, one-shot AP selection and per-sample optimal AP selection. To facilitate our analysis, we used a customized measurement system operating at 60 GHz, to record the signal power time series simultaneously received at 9 ceiling mounted AP locations while a mobile user imitating a voice call application. Using the time series data, the localized cross correlation coefficient (CCC) was subsequently estimated from the raw received signal strength (RSS) using the Spearman's rank-order correlation. It was found that the resultant time series of the localized CCCs was well-described by the Gaussian distribution across all of the considered measurement scenarios. Moreover, it was observed that the line-of-sight (LOS) and quasi-LOS (QLOS) paths typically led to higher CCC values with broader spreads than the non-LOS (NLOS) scenarios. To study the potential for signal enhancement by using diversity combining in mmWave DASs, we applied selection combining, equal gain combining and maximal ratio combining before investigating the AP selection mechanisms. Finally, we provide some useful insights into the influence of differing AP numbers on the diversity gain when considering the aforementioned AP selection methods.","School of Computing, Electronics and Maths"

Recent studies have highlighted ECG analysis as an effective method of diagnosing SA. Because the changes caused by SA on the ECG are imperceptible, the need for new methods in diagnosing this disease is required more than ever. Machine Learning (ML) is recognized as one of the most successful methods of computer aided diagnosis. ML uses new methods to diagnose diseases using past clinical results. The purpose of this study is to evaluate studies using ML algorithms based on ECG characteristics to assess people suffering from SA. In this study, systematically-reviewed articles written in English before October 2020 and indexed in PubMed, Scopus, Web of Science, and IEEE databases were searched with no lower time limit. From these articles, 48 were selected for further review. The selected articles adopteddifferent ML methods for classification. All of these studies were binary where SA was detected from the normal state based on a full ECG stripe (per record), or based on one-minute segments (per segment). Our analysis show that the most common features used in the studies were frequency, time series, and statistical features. Support-Vector Machine (SVM) and deep learning-based neural network (i.e. CNN, DNN) performed best in full record data detection. The highest accuracy, sensitivity, and specificity reported among the selected studies were 100%, which was obtained by an SVM. In another study, the classification was conducted based on ECG segments, and accordingly, the highest classification accuracy was observed in the residual neural network algorithm (RNN). The accuracy, sensitivity, and specificity of this algorithm were reported to be 99%. In general, it can be stated that ML techniques based on ECG characteristics have a high capability in diagnosing SA. These techniques can increase the diagnosis of patients with SA or the detection of SA episodes on ECG record, and can potentially prevent complications of the disease at later stages.","School of Computing, Electronics and Maths"

However, frequent bipolar converting and instantaneous high power demand challenge battery lifetime and operation cost in the FFR. Combining a battery with a supercapacitor (SC) has several advantages, but the system cost may rise. Targeting at the FFR service, this paper presents a new variable voltage control within a semi-active battery-supercapacitor hybrid scheme. In proposed hybrid energy storage system (HESS), the DC bus voltage is controllable so that to improve the SC use ratio meanwhile reduce converters cost. A power management strategy integrating fuzzy logic with dynamic filtering method is proposed benefiting in broadening the filtering flexibility while reducing battery degradation. In addition, both the long-term simulations and scaled-down experiments are implemented to verify the proposed topology with the control strategy and power management by quantitative comparisons of battery degradations and SC use ratios.","School of Computing, Electronics and Maths"

By means of Monte Carlo simulations and a finite-size scaling analysis we discuss the appearance of corrections to scaling for different definitions of cluster sets. We find that including all percolating clusters, or excluding only clusters that percolate in one but not the other direction, leads to smaller corrections to scaling for the average cluster size as compared to the other definitions considered. The percolation strength is less sensitive to the definitions used.","School of Computing, Electronics and Maths"

Fast discharge of the coil current is an effective method to protect the HTS magnet from quenching. In HTS magnets, metal plates are originally used to provide conduction cooling and mechanical support for the coil. During fast discharging operations, the metal plates can rapidly absorb part of the magnetic energy stored in the HTS coils through electromagnetic coupling. Previous studies are based on copper plates. This paper studies the influence of several promising metal materials on the discharging process of the HTS coils coupled with metal plates by experiments and simulations. The results show that in the explored resistance range, the higher the electrical conductivity of the metal plates, the better the acceleration of the current attenuation of coil at the early stage of discharging process. The effects of different metal plates on accelerating current attenuation of the coil are ranked as follows: SS 304L < Al 6061-T6 < Al (RRR = 30) < Cu (RRR = 30) < Au < Cu (RRR = 300) < Ag. However, Cu (RRR = 300) plates can absorb more energy from the HTS coil than the Ag plates during the discharging process. Copper with higher purity (Cu (RRR = 300)) and silver are promising alternatives for metal plates of HTS magnets. Generally, a fast current drop is always the most effective method for avoiding tape turn-out during a local quench; therefore, silver with the highest electrical conductivity is the best choice in view of quench protection.

Both electric vehicles and grid-scale battery energy storage have been growing fast in recent years. The active combination of these two kinds of energy sectors is challenging but will unlock extra flexibility at the distribution level. Therefore, the EV battery (EVB) and local battery (LB) are studied in a hybrid scheme for the first time. The scheme delivers an improved optimal power schedule for the fast frequency regulation (FFR) in the microgrid. A hybrid power management strategy based on an improved model predictive control (IMPC) in a microgrid is developed. The IMPC is advanced by adding the battery degradation prediction and EV capacity prediction in the loop and designed for optimal power-sharing with the minimum effect on battery lifetime. The EV battery status, which is critical for both the IMPC and the battery degradation quantification, is predicted by the deep learning approach. The proposed hybrid power management with IMPC is verified to be very effective with optimal power-sharing and battery anti-aging control in the microgrid application.","School of Computing, Electronics and Maths"

A tube shape and stacked opposing permanent magnets with magnetic spring were used to suit the shape constraint as well as to achieve high flux linkages. An initial prototype of electromagnetic vibration harvester with AA battery size was built and tested on a controllable shaker to obtain its output voltage and power level at different frequencies for fixed accelerations. A single magnet was fixed at the bottom of the harvester to provide levitation force in this development in order to lower the resonant frequency. A special time-domain based analytical model was also developed using both Finite Element Analysis and Simulink simulation. The time-domain analytical model is easier to implement than other frequency domain based analytical models which generally applied in literatures for modelling of the electromagnetic vibration energy harvesters. The analytical model was verified by the measured results obtained from the initial prototype. The validated analytical model was successfully applied to optimize the harvester. Two more generator prototypes were further built and tested after the optimization study. The optimized harvester using three stacked opposing permanent magnets could achieve a normalized power density of 12,655 μWcm−3 g−2 at 9.9 Hz frequency with 0.22 g acceleration, which is significantly higher than other reported electromagnetic vibration energy harvesters.","School of Computing, Electronics and Maths"

Improving the efficiency of electric air compressor is of great significance to energy saving of the PEMFC. In this study, the numerical equation of the internal flow channel of the TSEAC (Two-stage Electric Air Compressor) was established. The validity of the numerical equation was verified by the experimental study. It is found that the heat generated by the electric air compressor for the PEMFC is 2–4 times higher than that of the turbocharger for a traditional diesel engine. Besides, the temperature-rising characteristics of gas in the inner flow passage of the TSEAC are analyzed. Under its normal working conditions, the temperature rise of gas passing through impeller and diffuser reaches the maximum of 33.97 K and 48.95 K, respectively. Higher temperatures cause gas to be heated and expand more, thus increasing the compression power of compressed gas consumed, and the efficiency of the TSEAC is reduced. The theoretical compression power of the TSEAC with cooling compression process is calculated. It is concluded that shell cooling can reduce the export of first and second level compression stress and the second level compression inlet temperature. Under constant inlet pressure and temperature, shell cooling can reduce the internal power consumption of the TSEAC. In order to verify the feasibility of this study, the thermal conductivity of the TSEAC shell was increased from 273W/(m·K) to 397W/(m·K) and 524W/(m·K), the outlet temperature was decreased by 7.5 K and 12 K, and the maximum efficiency was increased by 1.3% and 2.4%, respectively.","School of Computing, Electronics and Maths"

We then ran interviews with students after the end of the module to produce qualitative data on perceptions of what feedback is, how useful it is, the uses made of it, and how it bears on engagement. A general finding was that human and automated feedback are different but complementary. However there are different feedback needs by group. Our findings imply: (1) that a blended human-automated feedback approach improves engagement; and (2) that this approach needs to be differentiated according to type of student.

The difference in the frequency of occurrence of certain synonymous codons over other synonymous codons is called the codon usage bias (CUB). The Zeng and Charlesworth model is used to estimate the strength of CUB. In their model the evolutionary process is represented by a Markov model, which allows the population size to vary over time. In this paper we propose a new method that incorporates demographic changes into the model. The method is a hybrid of two optimizers, the first is evolutionary programming and the second is a version of the genetic algorithms that uses chromosomes of variable lengths, which allows for expressing more demographic changes than what the simplified model presented by Zeng and Charlesworth does. We conduct several simulations to show why this hybridization is necessary, and also to show the superior performance of this new hybrid.","School of Computing, Electronics and Maths"

Besides, construction activities produce the highest amount of waste among all other sectors. According to the waste hierarchies, reuse is preferred to recycling; however, most of the recovery of construction and demolition wastes happens in the form of recycling and not reuse. Part of the recent efforts to promote the reuse rates includes estimating the reusability of the load-bearing building components to assist the stakeholders in making sound judgements of the reuse potentials at the end-of-life of a building and alleviate the uncertainties and perceived risks. This study aims to develop a probabilistic model using advanced supervised machine learning techniques (including random forest, K-Nearest Neighbours algorithm, Gaussian process, and support vector machine) to predict the reuse potential of structural elements at the end-of-life of a building. For this purpose, using an online questionnaire, this paper seeks the experts’ opinions with actual reuse experience in the building sector to assess the identified barriers by the authors in an earlier study. Furthermore, the results of the survey are used to develop an easy-to-understand learner for assessing the technical reusability of the structural elements at the end-of-life of a building. The results indicate that the most significant factors affecting the reuse of building structural components are design-related including, matching the design of the new building with the strength of the recovered element.","School of Computing, Electronics and Maths"

Multiple risk factors for COVID-19 have been identified including various demographics, co-morbidities, biochemical parameters, and physical assessment findings. However, using this vast data to improve clinical care has proven challenging.
Aims to develop a reliable, multivariable predictive model for COVID-19 in-patient outcomes, to aid risk-stratification and earlier clinical decision-making.
Methods Anonymized data regarding 44 independent predictor variables of 355 adults diagnosed with COVID-19, at a UK hospital, was manually extracted from electronic patient records for retrospective, case-controlled analysis. Primary outcomes included inpatient mortality, level of ventilatory support and oxygen therapy required, and duration of inpatient treatment. Secondary pulmonary embolism was the only secondary outcome. After balancing data, key variables were feature selected for each outcome using random forests. Predictive models were created using Bayesian Networks, and cross-validated.

Results Our multivariable models were able to predict, using feature selected risk factors, the probability of inpatient mortality (F1 score 83.7%, PPV 82%, NPV 67.9%); level of ventilatory support required (F1 score varies from 55.8% “High-flow Oxygen level” to 71.5% “ITU-Admission level”); duration of inpatient treatment (varies from 46.7% for “≥ 2 days but < 3 days” to 69.8% “≤ 1 day”); and risk of pulmonary embolism sequelae (F1 score 85.8%, PPV of 83.7%, and NPV of 80.9%).
Conclusion Overall, our findings demonstrate reliable, multivariable predictive models for 4 outcomes, that utilize readily available clinical information for COVID-19 adult inpatients. Further research is required to externally validate our models and demonstrate their utility as clinical decision-making tools.","School of Computing, Electronics and Maths"

The recent development of the advance digital sensors, actuators and controllers leverage the worldwide upgrade of transportation in terms of electrification and intellectualization. However, for smart EVs, this updating may challenge the in-vehicle network and then the vehicle control performance. In particular, the non-synchronous MPT and the TND are the key issues in the vehicle&#x0027;s integrated motion control, due to the absence of synchronization mechanism and limitation of communication bandwidth. To deal with the effects of coupled MPT and TND, a hybrid schedule-control framework (HSCF) is developed, where a new multiple-package transmissions scheduler is developed with a flexible time triggered schedule strategy with fractional-type basic period to eliminate the effect of the MPT and reorganize the TND to a bounded range of delay. Furthermore, an H-based linear quadratic regulator (LQR) control approach is designed to deal with the uncertainties caused by the time-varying network-induced delays as well as guarantee the system&#x0027;s stability. The effectiveness of the proposed scheme is verified in three cases by the real-time hardware-in-the-loop (HIL) bed tests.","School of Computing, Electronics and Maths"

Despite these advantages, APSoCs are sensitive to radiation like any other electronic device. Processors embedded in APSoCs, therefore, have to be adequately hardened against ionizing-radiation to make them a viable choice of design for harsh environments. This paper proposes a novel lockstep-based approach to harden the dual-core ARM Cortex-A9 processor in the Xilinx Zynq-7000 APSoC against radiation-induced soft errors by coupling it with a MicroBlaze TMR subsystem in the programmable logic (PL) layer of the Zynq. The proposed technique uses the concepts of checkpointing along with roll-back and roll-forward mechanisms at the software level, i.e. software redundancy, as well as processor replication and checker circuits at the hardware level (i.e. hardware redundancy). Results of fault injection experiments show that the proposed approach achieves high levels of protection against soft errors by mitigating around 98% of bit-flips injected into the register files of both ARM cores while keeping timing performance overhead as low as 25% if block and application sizes are adjusted appropriately. Furthermore, the incorporation of the roll-forward recovery operation in addition to the roll-back operation improves the Mean Workload between Failures (MWBF) of the system by up to ≈19% depending on the nature of the running application, since the application can proceed faster, in a scenario where a fault occurs, when treated with the roll-forward operation rather than roll-back operation. Thus, relatively more data can be processed before the next error occurs in the system.","School of Computing, Electronics and Maths"

The review utilised the PRISMA framework to review the analysis and synthesis process encompassing the search, screening, coding, and data analysis strategy of 141 items included in the corpus. Key findings extracted from the review incorporate a taxonomy of artificial intelligence applications with associated teaching and learning practice and a framework for helping teachers to develop and self-reflect on the skills and capabilities envisioned for employing artificial intelligence in education. Implications for ethical use and a set of propositions for enacting teaching and learning using artificial intelligence are demarcated. The findings of this review contribute to developing a better understanding of how artificial intelligence may enhance teachers’ roles as catalysts in designing, visualising, and orchestrating AI-enabled teaching and learning, and this will, in turn, help to proliferate AI-systems that render computational representations based on meaningful data-driven inferences of the pedagogy, domain, and learner models.","School of Computing, Electronics and Maths"

Such a case consists of the nonadjacent rotor breakages occurrence. Various alternatives with advanced digital signal processing algorithms have been proposed that concern the monitoring and analysis of the stator current, or the stray magnetic flux, of the motor during the transient start-up. Those methods work efficiently in most cases; however, the real issue is that most large industrial motors have very few start-ups during their long operating life time. In that sense, it is not feasible to implement the transient analysis-based methods. This article addresses an alternative methodology that solves this issue for induction motors at steady state. The method relies on a two-stage signal processing technique for frequency information tracking and extraction, where the higher harmonic index of the motor's torque around the sixth harmonic is evaluated during each stage. By the results of the method, it is evident that the fault and its severity level can be reliably detected at the steady state. The method's efficacy is proven valid even for challenging cases of large industrial motors, where the likelihood of a false diagnostic decision is increased during the signature screening.","School of Computing, Electronics and Maths"

The long-time behaviour of single-time and two-time correlation and response functions is analysed and the universal exponents which characterise quantum coarsening and quantum ageing are derived.

The proposed model combines the impact of inter-vehicle spacing and the radiation intensity distribution as a function of the irradiance angle which change with the traffic conditions. Three models (Lambertian, Gaussian and empirical) are utilized to examine the impact of vehicles headlights radiation pattern on the statistical path loss of VVLC system. The analytical model of channel path loss is validated by Monte Carlo simulation with the headlight model simulated with a raytracing software. The path loss values of the Gaussian model differ by 2 dB compared to the Lambertian model, irrespective of the traffic conditions while it differs by 24.6 dB during late night and 8.15 dB during rush hours compared to the empirical model of a Toyota Altis headlight. This variation shows that the radiation intensity distribution should be modelled for each vehicle's headlights from each manufacturer to ensure accurate VVLC channel model. The proposed Gaussian model provides a close approximation to describe such radiation pattern and can easily be adapted to model for different manufacturers headlights.","School of Computing, Electronics and Maths"

The richness of real-world data required for testing autonomous vehicles is limited and furthermore, available data do not present a fair representation of different scenarios and rare events. Before deploying autonomous vehicles publicly, their abilities must reach a safety threshold, not least with regards to vulnerable road users, such as pedestrians. In this paper, we present a novel Generative Adversarial Networks named the Ped-Cross GAN. Ped-Cross GAN is able to generate crossing sequences of pedestrians in the form of human pose sequences. The Ped-Cross GAN is trained with the Pedestrian Scenario dataset. The novel Pedestrian Scenario dataset, derived from existing datasets, enables training on richer pedestrian scenarios. We demonstrate an example of its use through training and testing the Ped-Cross GAN. The results show that the Ped-Cross GAN is able to generate new crossing scenarios that are of the same distribution from those contained in the Pedestrian Scenario dataset. Having a method with these capabilities is important for the future of transport, as it will allow for the adequate testing of Connected and Autonomous Vehicles on how they correctly perceive the intention of pedestrians crossing the street, ultimately leading to fewer pedestrian casualties on our roads.

Trophic levels of vertices can reveal their functional properties, partition and rank the vertices accordingly. Trophic levels and hence trophic coherence can only be defined on graphs with basal vertices, i.e. vertices with zero in-degree. Consequently, trophic analysis of graphs had been restricted until now. In this paper we introduce a hierarchical framework which can be defined on any simple graph. Within this general framework, we develop several metrics: hierarchical levels, a generalisation of the notion of trophic levels, influence centrality, a measure of a vertex’s ability to influence dynamics, and democracy coefficient, a measure of overall feedback in the system. We discuss how our generalisation relates to previous attempts and what new insights are illuminated on the topological and dynamical aspects of graphs. Finally, we show how the hierarchical structure of a network relates to the incidence rate in a SIS epidemic model and the economic insights we can gain through it.","School of Computing, Electronics and Maths"

Non-invasive retinal fundus imaging enables evaluation of the microvascular network and may offer insight to systemic risk associated with CKD. Methods: Retinal microvascular parameters (fractal dimension [FD] – a measure of the complexity of the vascular network, tortuosity, and retinal arteriolar and venular calibre) were quantified from macula-centred fundus images using the Vessel Assessment and Measurement Platform for Images of the REtina (VAMPIRE) version 3.1 (VAMPIRE group, Universities of Dundee and Edinburgh, Scotland) and assessed for associations with renal damage in a case-control study nested within the multi-centre UK Biobank cohort study. Participants were designated cases or controls based on urinary albumin to creatinine ratio (ACR) thresholds. Participants with ACR ≥ 3 mg/mmol (ACR stages A2-A3) were characterised as cases, and those with an ACR < 3 mg/mmol (ACR stage A1) were categorised as controls. Participants were matched on age, sex and ethnic background. Results: Lower FD (less extensive microvascular branching) was associated with a small increase in odds of albuminuria independent of blood pressure, diabetes and other potential confounding variables (odds ratio [OR] 1.18, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.03–1.34 for arterioles and OR 1.24, CI 1.05–1.47 for venules). Measures of tortuosity or retinal arteriolar and venular calibre were not significantly associated with ACR. Conclusions: This study supports previously reported associations between retinal microvascular FD and other metabolic disturbances affecting the systemic vasculature. The association between retinal microvascular FD and albuminuria, independent of diabetes and blood pressure, may represent a useful indicator of systemic vascular damage associated with albuminuria.","School of Computing, Electronics and Maths"

Due to its low complexity and ease of implementation, we consider the use of a switch-and-examine combining with post-examining selection (SECps) scheme to combine the signal received by the DAS. During our experiments, a pedestrian wearing a wireless device on their chest either stood stationary or walked by the side of a road. It was found that the overall signal reliability depends on not only the number, but also different groupings of the antennas which are selected. The goodness-of-fit results have shown that the temporal behavior of the diversity gain was adequately described by the Gaussian distribution. Building upon this, we also provide some useful insights into the antenna selection through the comparison of three different antenna selection mechanisms, namely per-sample random antenna selection, one-shot antenna selection and per-sample optimal antenna selection.","School of Computing, Electronics and Maths"

Depending on what fixed step-size the MPPT controller implements, there is an impact on settling time to reach the maximum power point (MPP) and the steady state operation for conventional tracking techniques. This paper presents experimental results of an adaptive tracking technique based on Perturb and Observe (P&O) and Incremental Conductance (IC) for standalone Photovoltaic (PV) systems under uniform irradiance and partial shading conditions. Analysis and verification of measured and MATLAB/Simulink simulation results have been carried out. The adaptive tracking technique splits the operational region of the solar PV’s power–voltage characteristic curve into four and six operational sectors to understand the MPP response and stability of the technique. By implementing more step-sizes at sector locations based on the distance of the sector from the MPP, the challenges associated with fixed step-size is improved on.The measured and simulation results clearly indicate that the proposed system tracks MPP faster and displays better steady state operation than conventional system. The proposed system’s tracking efficiency is over 10% greater than the conventional system for all techniques. The proposed system has been under partial shading condition has been and it outperforms other techniques with the GMPP achieved in 0.9 s which is better than conventional techniques.","School of Computing, Electronics and Maths,School of Mechanical, Aerospace and Automotive Engineering"

Evaluation must account for social, political, environmental and other conditions, such as flood state expectations and local priorities. The evaluation method should be able to quickly identify evolving investment needs as the incidence and magnitude of flood events continue to grow. Quantification is essential and must consider multiple direct and indirect effects on flood related outcomes. The method proposed is this study is a Bayesian network, which may be used ex-post for evaluation, but also ex-ante for future assessment, and near real-time for the reallocation of investment into interventions. The particular case we study is the effect of flood interventions upon mental health, which is a gap in current investment analyses. Natural events such as floods expose people to negative mental health disorders including anxiety, distress and post-traumatic stress disorder. Such outcomes can be mitigated or exacerbated not only by state funded interventions, but by individual and community skills and experience. Success is also dampened when vulnerable and previously exposed victims are affected. Current measures evaluate solely the effectiveness of interventions to reduce physical damage to people and assets. This paper contributes a design for a Bayesian network that exposes causal pathways and conditional probabilities between interventions and mental health outcomes as well as providing a tool that can readily indicate the level of investment needed in alternative interventions based on desired mental health outcomes.","School of Computing, Electronics and Maths"

To achieve this, we measured the signal power simultaneously received at nine ceiling-mounted access point (AP) locations likely to be used in future indoor DAS deployments while a mobile user imitated making a voice call on a hypothetical user equipment. Key metrics, associated with the performance of multiple antenna systems, such as the cross correlation coefficient (CCC) and channel power imbalance (CPI) are determined. It was found that line-of-sight (LOS) and quasi-LOS (QLOS) links with the APs typically led to higher CCC values than the non-LOS (NLOS) cases. Similarly, LOS and QLOS links typically produced higher CPI values between APs than the NLOS case. To enable the reproduction of our results, we have successfully applied autoregressive moving average and autoregressive integrated moving average modeling to the CCC and CPI time series. The performance improvement that can be achieved using a DAS instead of a single AP was evaluated using three commonly deployed diversity combining schemes, namely, selection combining, equal gain combining, and maximal ratio combining along with three AP selection mechanisms, namely, per-sample random AP selection, one-shot AP selection, and per-sample optimal AP selection. Finally, we have provided some useful insight into the influence of differing AP numbers on the diversity gain when considering the aforementioned AP selection methods.","School of Computing, Electronics and Maths"

Motivated by the fact that the senses of a word can be sophisticatedly embedded into the semantic space using a distributed representation, this paper hypothesizes that each sense of a word can be represented by one or more specific dimensions, and thus the target of aspect-level sentiment classification can be simplified into searching the related dimensions for the aspects and sentiments concerned. Particularly, an Attention Vector (ATV) based on attention mechanism is designed for each aspect in terms of a specific task, which involves two sub-vectors, i.e., a Dimension Attention Vector (DATV) and a Sentiment Attention Vector (SATV). The DATV determines the significances of different dimensions based on their correlations with an aspect; and the SATV allocates weights for the attributes of words, which are decided by sentiment polarities and part-of-speech (PoS) tagging. Given a sub-dataset related to an aspect, the ATV will be optimized by an Artificial Bee Colony (ABC) algorithm with a Support Vector Machine (SVM) classifier, the objective of which is to maximize classification accuracy. Intrinsically, the DATV can reduce the ambiguity existing in polysemy, meanwhile, the SATV is an auxiliary means for the optimization of the DATV, which can help eliminate the misunderstandings caused by antonyms. Then, the optimized DATV will be applied on a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model via simply scaling the pretrained word embeddings as inputs (named as ATV-CNN model). Experimental results show that the ATV-CNN model can have substantial advantages when compared with state-of-the-art models.","School of Computing, Electronics and Maths"

Second, according to the applicable network types, we propose a taxonomy to divide the existing NMF-based methods for community detection into six categories, namely, topology networks, signed networks, attributed networks, multilayer networks, dynamic networks, and large-scale networks. We deeply analyze representative methods in every category. Finally, we summarize the common problems faced by all methods and potential solutions and propose four promising research directions.

Also, the possible effects of heterogeneity in the studied studies are investigated using meta-regression analysis. Result: In 10 articles and 8798 participants aged between11–40, the overall prevalence of insomnia in the third trimester of pregnancy based on meta-analysis was 42.4% (95% CI: 32.9–52.5%). It was reported that as the sample size increases, the prevalence of insomnia in the third trimester of pregnancy increases. Conversely, as the year of research increases, the prevalence of insomnia in the third trimester of pregnancy decreases. Both of these differences were statistically significant (P < 0.05). Conclusion: Insomnia was highly prevalent in the last trimester of pregnancy. Sleep disorders are neglected among pregnant women, and they are considered natural. While sleep disturbances can cause mental and physical problems in pregnant women, they can consequently cause problems for the fetus. As a result, maintaining the physical and mental health of pregnant mothers is very important. It is thus recommended that in addition to having regular visits during pregnancy, pregnant women should also be continuously monitored for sleep-related disorders.","School of Computing, Electronics and Maths"

STEAM is a game designed for helping school teachers to gain awareness of how multimodality may be enacted in the classroom for enhancing the student learning experience. The game embraces the notion of multimodal teaching and learning, as a way to present multiple representations of content such as text, images, video, audio and pervasive media, by augmenting modes with tools, teaching strategies and locations as means to create ideational, interpersonal and textual meanings. A questionnaire was employed to school teachers (n = 54) for understanding how multimodality was experienced through using the serious game as (1) stipulating diversity and increasing knowledge retention, (2) developing senses for attaining deeper understanding of the subject topic, (3) involving students into learning design and (4) supporting student’s autonomy and self-direction. The findings revealed an explicit connection between theory and practice as experienced through the game’s semiotic domain whilst contemplating on attempts to transcend experiences of in-game multimodality to lived classrooms.","School of Computing, Electronics and Maths"

In this paper, a novel frequency-dependent plasticity mechanism (FDSP) for neurocomputing applications is presented. It is proposed that synaptic junctions could be used to perform bandpass filtering on the input stimulus. The unique transfer function of a bandpass filter replaces the conventional weight value associated with synaptic connections. The proposed model has been simulated and rigorously tested with standard machine learning benchmarks such as XOR and multivariate IRIS dataset while utilising minimum resources. The proposed model offers a unique advantage and has the potential to overcome the burden of hidden layer neurons from the network. Exclusion of hidden layer from the network significantly reduces the size of the network and hence the computational effort required for classification tasks. The proposed FDSP mechanism allows for complete analogue system design with a frequency multiplexed communication scheme. The main goal of this study is to establish frequency-dependent plasticity as an alternative to existing time-domain based techniques. The proposed method has a number of applications in neurocomputing, low power IoT devices and compute-efficient Deep Convolutional Neural Networks (DCNNs).","School of Computing, Electronics and Maths"

Because preschool and kindergarten learners are capable of exercising their cognitive abilities to resolve basic computational logic, this demographic has raised significant interest in studying their learning intentions and behaviors. However, prior research fails to examine the effects of teaching computational logic to kindergarten children. Therefore, this study aims to investigate the influences of teaching approaches in guiding preschool children to learn computational logic and programming concepts to enhance their problem-solving skills as well as computational thinking abilities. A novel teaching framework is designed to develop the learner's cognitive abilities, which adopts the smart toy game-based learning approach along with a tangible user interface (TUI) to enhance children's learning performance and interests. The proposed teaching approach integrates the game-based learning concepts into the TUI system, where the learning processes allow the learners to effectively practice the conceptual knowledge and efficiently advance their problem-solving skills. The results suggest using the developed game-based TUI system can increase preschool children's learning behaviors as well as enhance their learning interests and computational thinking abilities.","School of Computing, Electronics and Maths"

Most of the existing learning-based methods for catheter segmentation and tracking are only trained on smallscale datasets or synthetic data due to the difficulties of ground-truth annotation. Furthermore, the temporal continuity in intraoperative imaging sequences is not fully utilised. In,this paper, we present FW-Net, an end-to-end and real-time deep learning framework for endovascular intervention. The proposed FW-Net has three modules: a segmentation network with encoder-decoder architecture, a flow network to extract optical flow information, and a novel flow-guided warping function to learn the frame-to-frame temporal continuity. We show that by effectively learning temporal continuity, the network can successfully segment and track the catheters in real-time sequences using only raw ground-truth for training. Detailed validation results confirm that our FW-Net outperforms stateof-,the-art techniques while achieving real-time performance.","School of Computing, Electronics and Maths"

More recently it is finding prominence in the Satisfiability Checking community as a tool to identify satisfying solutions of problems in nonlinear real arithmetic.,The original algorithm produces decompositions according to the signs of polynomials, when what is usually required is a decomposition according to the truth of a formula containing those polynomials.  One approach to achieve that coarser (but hopefully cheaper) decomposition is to reduce the polynomials identified in the CAD to reflect a logical structure which reduces the solution space dimension: the presence of Equational Constraints (ECs).,This paper may act as a tutorial for the use of CAD with ECs: we describe all necessary background and the current state of the art.  In particular, we present recent work on how McCallum's theory of reduced projection may be leveraged to make further savings in the lifting phase: both to the polynomials we lift with and the cells lifted over.  We give a new complexity analysis to demonstrate that the double exponent in the worst case complexity bound for CAD reduces in line with the number of ECs.  We show that the reduction can apply to both the number of polynomials produced and their degree.  ","School of Computing, Electronics and Maths"

Frost events can be characterized by duration and severity. This paper investigates the risk and impacts of frost phenomenon in the vineyards by modeling the joint distribution of duration and severity factors and analyzing the influential parameter’s dependency structure using capabilities of copula functions. A novel mathematical framework is developed within this study to understand the risk and uncertainties associate with frost events and the impacts on yields of vineyards by analyzing the non-linear dependency structure using copula functions as an efficient tool.

Under normality assumption for the genes, GRNs can be constructed by assessing the nonzero elements of the inverse covariance matrix. Nevertheless, such techniques are unable to deal with non-normality, multi-modality and heavy tailedness that are commonly seen in current massive genetic data. To relax this limitative constraint, one can apply copula function which is a multivariate cumulative distribution function with uniform marginal distribution. However, since the dependency structures of different pairs of genes in a multivariate problem are very different, the regular multivariate copula will not allow for the construction of an appropriate model. The solution to this problem is using Pair-Copula Constructions (PCCs) which are decompositions of a multivariate density into a cascade of bivariate copula, and therefore, assign different bivariate copula function for each local term. In fact, in this paper, we have constructed inverse covariance matrix based on the use of PCCs when the normality assumption can be moderately or severely violated for capturing a wide range of distributional features and complex dependency structure. To learn the non-Gaussian model for the considered GRN with non-Gaussian genomic data, we apply modified version of copula-based PC algorithm in which normality assumption of marginal densities is dropped. This paper also considers the Dynamic Time Warping (DTW) algorithm to determine the existence of a time delay relation between two genes.

The four UK countries (England, Northern Ireland, Scotland and Wales) provide a potential ‘natural experiment’ for comparing intervention patterns. This study reports on a large quantitative, descriptive study focusing on children in contact with children’s services on a single date in 2015. It found that children’s chances of receiving a child protection intervention were related to family socio-economic circumstances, measured by neighbourhood deprivation, within all four countries. There was a strong social gradient which was significantly steeper in some countries than others. Ethnicity was another important factor underlying inequalities. While inequalities in patterns of intervention between the four countries were considerable, they did not mirror relative levels of deprivation in the child population. Inequalities in intervention rates result from a combination of demand and supply factors. The level and extent of inequity raise profound ethical, economic and practical challenges to those involved in child protection, the wider society and the state.","School of Computing, Electronics and Maths"

In particular, user-induced effects can lead to significant channel variations depending on the user equipment (UE) usage mode which in turn, can impact the quality of service. Estimation of UE operating conditions is therefore critical for optimal radio resource management. We propose a new approach to user activity recognition which makes use of both supervised and unsupervised machine learning. In particular, using information extracted from the received signal strength (RSS), a common metric readily available from many receiver chipsets, we perform a classification of user state (static or mobile relative to an access point) and UE mode of operation (voice call, using an app or in pocket). To develop and then train our classification system, measured RSS data was obtained using a custom 60 GHz measurement system for a range of indoor office scenarios which considered various UE to ceiling mounted access point configurations. In our approach, differentiation between static and mobile states is performed in preprocessing using a k-means algorithm. Small-scale fading features are then estimated from the RSS data and, using different feature scaling mechanisms, various supervised learning approaches are applied to investigate the optimal classification accuracy for the considered use cases in this work. We compare the classification performance of various window sizes and types, and show that a sliding window length of 1s without overlap performs best for time series segmentation at 60 GHz for the activities considered in this study. Among the different supervised learning approaches, the Decision Tree (DT) classifier performs best for both the user static and mobile cases with an accuracy of 100% and 98.0%, respectively. For static cases, user orientation, i.e., line-of-sight (LOS), quasi-LOS, and non-LOS, can also be classified and here the DT classifier also performs best with an accuracy of 98.2%, 97.6% and 100% for the voice call, using an app or in pocket use cases. Additionally, a feature ranking algorithm, called ReliefF, is adopted to determine the small-scale fading features that have the most significant influences on the classification accuracy and three different feature sets, namely Full, Reduced and Constrained sets, are then proposed based on feature ranking results. This allows the proposed techniques to be deployed on wireless platforms with different levels of processing capability.","School of Computing, Electronics and Maths"

Chatrabgoun,A. Daneshkhah",A low cost and highly accurate technique for big data spatial-temporal interpolation,"The high velocity, variety and volume of data generation by today's systems have necessitated Big Data (BD) analytic techniques. This has penetrated a wide range of industries; BD as a notion has various types and characteristics, and therefore a variety of analytic techniques would be required. The traditional analysis methods are typically unable to analyse spatial-temporal BD. Interpolation is required to approximate the values between the already existing data points, yet since there exist both location and time dimensions, only a multivariate interpolation would be appropriate. Nevertheless, existing software are unable to perform such complex interpolations. To overcome this challenge, this paper presents a layer by layer interpolation approach for spatial-temporal BD. Developing this layered structure provides the opportunity for working with much smaller linear system of equations. Consequently, this structure increases the accuracy and stability of numerical structure of the considered BD interpolation.

An interactive card-based activity was used within a small scale focus group, with the purpose of enabling dialogue between end-users (n = 11), as to elicit their experiences of using games for understanding athletes’ dual career training needs. Initial findings from this exercise was a suggestion that quantifiable performance indicators (scores, points, achievements) could be preferable to less quantifiable measures (e.g. narrative progression, or multiple scenario outcomes). Establishing meaning, sense-of-purpose, and identity within the game were also highlighted as desirable features by the focus group, when compared to other options as detailed in this paper. The subsequent prototype of the game is presented, with reference to these findings.","School of Computing, Electronics and Maths"

The proposed methodology is improved in two ways. Firstly, to give a prediction of the available electric vehicle (EV) battery capacity in the control time-step for the V2G service, a deep learning based prediction is developed. Secondly, this study advances the previous V2G method by adding the quantitative analysis of the battery cycle life into the V2G optimization. The accurate prediction of the schedulable battery capacity based on the LSTM algorithm is shown very effective in the power system frequency control. Also, compared with the previous method that without battery lifetime control, the proposed method benefits in the reduction of charge/discharge cycles.","School of Computing, Electronics and Maths"

Mining interesting knowledge from this textual data is a challenging task because it consists of unstructured or semistructured text that are written in natural language. In the field of artificial intelligence, event-oriented techniques are helpful in addressing this problem, where information retrieval (IR), information extraction (IE) and graph methods (GMs) are three of the most important paradigms in supporting event-oriented processing. In recent years, due to information explosions, textual event detection and recognition have received extensive research attention and achieved great success. Many surveys have been conducted to retrospectively assess the development of event detection. However, until now, all of these surveys have focused on only a single aspect of IR, IE or GMs. There is no research that provides a complete introduction or a comparison of IR, IE, and GMs. In this article, a survey about these techniques is provided from a broader perspective, and a convenient and comprehensive comparison of these techniques is given. The hallmark of this article is that it is the first survey that combines IR, IE and GMs in a single frame and will therefore benefit researchers by acting as a reference in this field.","School of Computing, Electronics and Maths"

Nazmul Huda, Zhichuan Tang, Li Sun",A self-propelled robotic system with a visco-elastic joint: Dynamics and Motion Analysis,"This paper studies the dynamics and motion generation of a self-propelled robotic system with a visco-elastic joint. The system is underactuated, legless and wheelless, and has potential applications in environmental inspection and operation in restricted spaces which are inaccessible to human beings, such as pipeline inspection, medical assistance and disaster rescue. Locomotion of the system relies on the stick–slip effects, which interacts with the frictional force of the surface in contact. The nonlinear robotic model utilizes combined tangential-wise and normal-wise vibrations for underactuated locomotion, which features a generic significance for the studies on self-propelled systems. To identify the characteristics of the visco-elastic joint and shed light on the energy efficacy, parameter dependences on stiffness and damping coefficients are thoroughly analysed. Our studies demonstrate that the dynamic behaviour of the self-propelled system is mainly periodic and desirable forward motion is achieved via identification of the variation laws of the control parameters and elaborate selection of the stiffness and damping coefficients. A motion generation strategy is developed, and an analytical two-stage motion profile is proposed based on the system response and dynamic constraint analysis, followed by a parameterization procedure to optimally generate the trajectory. The proposed method provides a novel approach in generating self-propelled locomotion, and designing and computing the visco-elastic parameters for energy efficacy. Simulation results are presented to demonstrate the effectiveness and feasibility of the proposed model and motion generation approach.","School of Computing, Electronics and Maths"

This paper presents an initial fusion approach of data collected from ambient (contact and thermal) and wearable (accelerometer) sensors in a smart environment to improve the recognition of the main steps of ADLs. An accurate recognition of these steps can support detecting abnormal behaviour in the form of deviations from the expected steps. The smart environment used is a smart kitchen and the ADLs considered are (i) prepare and drink tea, and (ii) prepare and drink coffee. These ADLs are deemed to have many occurrences during a typical day of a (elderly) person. The fusion approach presented considers the extraction of the most relevant features of the data collected from the two types of sensors (ambient and wearable) and the subsequent data analysis to recognise the main steps involved in the ADLs. Results show that this initial approach slightly improves the recognition of the main steps involved in the ADLs compared to the results obtained with just using data from the wearable sensors.","School of Computing, Electronics and Maths"

It is shown that a multi-layer neural network (NN) with the proposed receiver scheme outperforms other machine learning (ML) algorithms and can offer high accuracy with root mean square (RMS) error of 0.22 m and 0.14 m during the day and night time, respectively.  Furthermore, the NN shows robustness in VLP across different weather conditions and road scenarios. The results show that only dense fog deteriorates the performance of the system due to reduced visibility across the road.","School of Strategy and Leadership,School of Computing, Electronics and Maths"

This paper presents an audio modulator with high accuracy and low power consumption by using a discrete second-order feedforward structure. A 5-bit successive approximation register (SAR) quantizer is integrated into the chip, which reduces the number of comparators and the power consumption of the quantizer compared with flash ADC-type quantizers. An analogue passive adder is used to sum the input signals and it is embedded in a SAR ADC composed of a capacitor array and a dynamic comparator which has no static power consumption. To validate the design concept, the designed modulator is developed in a 180 nm CMOS process. The peak signal to noise distortion ratio (SNDR) is calculated as 106 dB and the total power consumption of the chip is recorded as 3.654 mW at the chip supply voltage of 1.8 V. The input sine wave of 0 to 25 kHz is sampled at a sampling frequency of 3.2 Ms/s. Moreover, the results achieve a 16-bit effective number of bits (ENOB) when the amplitude of the input signal is varied between 0.15 and 1.65 V. By comparing with other modulators which were realized by a 180 nm CMOS process, the proposed architecture outperforms with lower power consumption.","School of Computing, Electronics and Maths"

Although multiple risk factors for COVID-19 have been identified, using this data to improve clinical care has proven challenging. The main aim of this study is to develop a reliable, multivariable predictive model for COVID-19 in-patient outcomes, thus enabling risk-stratification and earlier clinical decision-making. Methods: Anonymised data consisting of 44 independent predictor variables from 355 adults diagnosed with COVID-19, at a UK hospital, was manually extracted from electronic patient records for retrospective, case–control analysis. Primary outcomes included inpatient mortality, required ventilatory support, and duration of inpatient treatment. Pulmonary embolism sequala was the only secondary outcome. After balancing data, key variables were feature selected for each outcome using random forests. Predictive models were then learned and constructed using Bayesian networks. Results: The proposed probabilistic models were able to predict, using feature selected risk factors, the probability of the mentioned outcomes. Overall, our findings demonstrate reliable, multivariable, quantitative predictive models for four outcomes, which utilise readily available clinical information for COVID-19 adult inpatients. Further research is required to externally validate our models and demonstrate their utility as risk stratification and clinical decision-making tools.","School of Computing, Electronics and Maths"

In this paper, we present a novel approach for plagiarism detection without reference collections. The proposed approach relies on using some statistical properties of the most common words, and the Latent Semantic Analysis that is applied to extract the most common words usage patterns. This method aims to generate a model of author’s “style” by revealing a set of certain features of authorship. The model generation procedure focuses on just one author, as an attempt to summarise the aspects of an author’s style in a definitive and clear-cut manner. The feature set of the intrinsic model were based on the frequency of the most common words, their relative frequencies in the book series, and the deviation of these frequencies across all books for a particular author. The approach has been evaluated using the leave-one-out-cross-validation method on the CEN (Corpus of English Novel) data set. Results have indicated that, by integrating deep latent semantic and stylometric analyses, hidden changes can be identified when a reference collection does not exist. The results have also shown that our Multi-Layer Perceptron based approach statistically outperforms Bayesian Network, Support Vector Machine and Random Forest models, by accurately predicting the author classes with an overall accuracy of 97%.

Micro-Doppler radars are an appealing solution considering their non-intrusiveness, deep penetration, and high-distance range. Unsupervised activity recognition using Doppler radar data has not received attention, in spite of its importance in case of unlabelled or poorly labelled activities in real scenarios. This study proposes two unsupervised feature extraction methods for the purpose of human activity monitoring using Doppler-streams. These include a local Discrete Cosine Transform (DCT)-based feature extraction method and a local entropy-based feature extraction method. In addition, a novel application of Convolutional Variational Autoencoder (CVAE) feature extraction is employed for the first time for Doppler radar data. The three feature extraction architectures are compared with the previously used Convolutional Autoencoder (CAE) and linear feature extraction based on Principal Component Analysis (PCA) and 2DPCA. Unsupervised clustering is performed using K-Means and K-Medoids. The results show the superiority of DCT-based method, entropy-based method, and CVAE features compared to CAE, PCA, and 2DPCA, with more than 5%-20% average accuracy. In regards to computation time, the two proposed methods are noticeably much faster than the existing CVAE. Furthermore, for high-dimensional data visualisation, three manifold learning techniques are considered. The methods are compared for the projection of raw data as well as the encoded CVAE features. All three methods show an improved visualisation ability when applied to the encoded CVAE features.","School of Computing, Electronics and Maths"

The method consists of two main steps: Initially, a time-frequency transformation is used and the focus is given on the steady-state regime; thereupon, the fault-related frequencies are handled as periodical signals over time and the classical fast Fourier transform is used for the evaluation of their own spectral content. This leads to the discrimination of subcomponents related to the fault and to the evaluation of their amplitudes. The versatility of the proposed method relies on the fact that it reveals the aforementioned signatures to detect the fault, regardless of the spatial location of the broken rotor bars. Extensive finite element simulations on a 1.1 MW induction motor and experimental testing on a 1.1 kW induction motor lead to the conclusion that the method can be generalized on any type of induction motor independently from the size, power, number of poles, and rotor slot numbers.","School of Computing, Electronics and Maths"

Due to its low cost as well as easy availability of data sharing and accessing devices, the Internet of Things (IoT) has grown exponentially during the past few years. The availability of these devices plays a remarkable role in the new era of mHealth. In mHealth, the sensors generate enormous amounts of data and the context-aware computing has proven to collect and manage the data. The context aware computing is a new domain to be aware of context of involved devices. The context-aware computing is playing a very significant part in the development of smart mobile health applications to monitor the health of patients more efficiently. Security is one of the key challenges in IoT-based mHealth application development. The wireless nature of IoT devices motivates attackers to attack on application; these vulnerable attacks can be denial of service attack, sinkhole attack, and select forwarding attack. These attacks lead intruders to disrupt the application's functionality, data packet drops to malicious end and changes the route of data and forwards the data packet to other location. There is a need to timely detect and prevent these threats in mobile health applications. Existing work includes many security frameworks to secure the mobile health applications but all have some drawbacks. This paper presents existing frameworks, the impact of threats on applications, on information, and different security levels.

Our focus is selecting the variable ordering for cylindrical algebraic decomposition (CAD), an important algorithm implemented in several CASs, and now also SMT-solvers. We created a framework to describe all the previously identified ML features for the problem and then enumerated all options in this framework to automatically generate many more features. We validate the usefulness of these with an experiment which shows that an ML choice for CAD variable ordering is superior to those made by human created heuristics, and further improved with these additional features.

In turn, that is one of the factors deterring the commercialization of this technology. The forward Current-Voltage (I-V) characteristics in these devices carry considerable information about the material quality. In this context, an advanced Technology Computer Aided Design (TCAD) model is proposed and validated with measurements obtained from a fabricated and characterized Platinum/3C-SiC-on-Si Schottky Barrier Diode with scope to shed light in the physical carrier transport mechanisms, the impact of traps and their characteristics on the actual device performance. The model includes defects originating from both the Schottky contact and the hetero-interface of 3C-SiC with Si, which allows the investigation of their impact on the magnification of the sub-threshold current. Further, the simulation results and measured data allowed for the identification of additional distributions of interfacial states, the effect of which is linked to the observed non-uniformities of the Barrier Height value. A comprehensive characterization of the defects affecting the carrier transport mechanisms of the investigated 3C-SiC-on-Si power diode is thus achieved and the proposed TCAD model is able to accurately predict the device current both during forward and reverse bias conditions.","School of Computing, Electronics and Maths"

Glaucoma is a common eye condition where the optic nerve that connects the eye to the brain becomes damaged, whereas DR is a complication of diabetes caused by high blood sugar levels damaging the back of the eye. In order to produce an accurate and early diagnosis, an extremely high number of retinal images needs to be processed. Given the required computational complexity of image processing algorithms and the need for high-performance architectures, this paper proposes and demonstrates the use of fully parallel field programmable gate arrays (FPGAs) to overcome the burden of real-time,computing in conventional software architectures. The experimental results achieved through software implementation were validated on an FPGA device. The results showed a remarkable improvement in terms of computational speed and power consumption. This paper presents various preprocessing methods to analyse fundus images, which can serve as a diagnostic tool for detection of glaucoma and diabetic retinopathy. In the proposed adaptive thresholding-based preprocessing method, features were selected by calculating the area of the segmented optic disk, which was further classified using a feedforward neural network (NN). The analysis was carried out using feature extraction,through existing methodologies such as adaptive thresholding, histogram and wavelet transform. Results obtained through these methods were quantified to obtain optimum performance in terms of classification accuracy. The proposed hardware implementation outperforms existing methods and oers a significant improvement in terms of computational speed and power consumption.

Aimed at providing such proximity service (ProSe) for mission-critical data exchange in the post-flood environment, the majority of existing solutions rely heavily upon ad-hoc networking approaches, which suffer from restricted communication range and the limited scope of interaction. As an effort to broaden the ProSe coverage and expand integrated global-local information exchange in the post-flood SAR activities, this paper proposes a novel network architecture in the form of a cyber-enabled mission-critical system (CEMCS) for acquiring and communicating post-flood emergency data by exploiting TV white space spectrum as network backhaul links. The primary method of developing the proposed system builds upon a layered architecture of wireless local, regional and wide-area communications, and incorporates collaborative network components among these layers. The desirable functionalities of CEMCS are showcased through formulation and the development of an efficient global search strategy exploiting a wide range of collaboration among network agents.

To improve the performance of LDA, heteroscedastic LDA (HLDA) that removes the equal covariance assumption has been developed. In this paper, we show using first and second-order optimality conditions that the existing approaches either have no principled computational procedure for optimal parameter selection, or underperform in terms of the accuracy of classification and the area under the receiver operating characteristics curve (AUC) under class imbalance. Using the same optimality conditions, we then derive a dynamic Bayes optimal linear classifier for heteroscedastic LDA that is optimised via an efficient iterative procedure, which is robust against class imbalance. Experimental work is conducted on two artificial and eight real-world datasets. Our results show that the proposed algorithm compares favourably with the existing heteroscedastic LDA procedures as well as the linear support vector machine (SVM) in terms of the error rate, but is superior to all the algorithms in terms of the AUC under class imbalance. The fast training time of the proposed algorithm also encourages its use for large-data applications that show high incidence of class imbalance, such as in human activity recognition.","School of Computing, Electronics and Maths"

The aim of this paper is to outsource network coverage of a specific area according to a desired quality of service requirement and to enable various entities in the network to have intelligence to make autonomous decisions using blockchain and auction mechanisms. In this regard, by considering a multiple-UAV network where each UAV is associated to its own controlling operator, this paper addresses two major challenges: the selection of the UAV for the desired quality of network coverage and the development of a distributed and autonomous real-time monitoring framework for the enforcement of service level agreement (SLA). For a suitable UAV selection, we employ a reputation-based auction mechanism to model the interaction between the business agent who is interested in outsourcing the network coverage and the UAV operators serving in closeby areas. In addition, theoretical analysis is performed to show that the proposed auction mechanism attains a dominant strategy equilibrium. For the SLA enforcement and trust model, we propose a permissioned blockchain architecture considering Support Vector Machine (SVM) for real-time autonomous and distributed monitoring of UAV service. In particular, smart contract features of the blockchain are invoked for enforcing the SLA terms of payment and penalty, and for quantifying the UAV service reputation. Simulation results confirm the accuracy of theoretical analysis and efficacy of the proposed model.","School of Computing, Electronics and Maths"

To combat effects of multipath and fading for the UVLC system over turbulence channels, optical orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (O -OFDM) schemes with the transceiver spatial diversity were proposed, which employed equal gain combining (EGC) at the receiver side. Underwater path loss was calculated by a generalized Lambertian formula, and the fading induced by weak turbulence was modelled as a lognormal -distribution random variable. Based on the channel model and Monte Carlo (MC) simulation, the bit error ratio (BER) performance for quadrature - amplitude modulation (QAM) asymmetrically clipped optical OFDM (ACO -OFDM) and DC -biased optical OFDM (DCO -OFDM) systems in the channel with and without turbulence was evaluated. Furthermore, the diversity gain was estimated for different diversity orders and scintillation indexes. The results demonstrate that the diversity scheme with EGC is an effective measure to reduce the effect of turbulence and could be useful for designing, predicting, and evaluating the performance of O -OFDM UVLC system in a weak oceanic turbulence condition.","School of Computing, Electronics and Maths"

Today, nurses and physicians are faced with unprecedented work pressures in the face of the COVID-19 pandemic, resulting in several psychological disorders such as stress, anxiety and sleep disturbances. The aim of this study is to investigate the prevalence of sleep disturbances in hospital nurses and physicians facing the COVID-19 patients. Method: A systematic review and metanalysis was conducted in accordance with the PRISMA criteria. The PubMed, Scopus, Science direct, Web of science, CINHAL, Medline, and Google Scholar databases were searched with no lower time-limt and until 24 June 2020. The heterogeneity of the studies was measured using I2 test and the publication bias was assessed by the Egger's test at the significance level of 0.05. Results: The I2 test was used to evaluate the heterogeneity of the selected studies, based on the results of I2 test, the prevalence of sleep disturbances in nurses and physicians is I2: 97.4% and I2: 97.3% respectively. After following the systematic review processes, 7 cross-sectional studies were selected for meta-analysis. Six studies with the sample size of 3745 nurses were examined in and the prevalence of sleep disturbances was approximated to be 34.8% (95% CI: 24.8-46.4%). The prevalence of sleep disturbances in physicians was also measured in 5 studies with the sample size of 2123 physicians. According to the results, the prevalence of sleep disturbances in physicians caring for the COVID-19 patients was reported to be 41.6% (95% CI: 27.7-57%). Conclusion: Healthcare workers, as the front line of the fight against COVID-19, are more vulnerable to the harmful effects of this disease than other groups in society. Increasing workplace stress increases sleep disturbances in the medical staff, especially nurses and physicians. In other words, increased stress due to the exposure to COVID-19 increases the prevalence of sleep disturbances in nurses and physicians. Therefore, it is important for health policymakers to provide solutions and interventions to reduce the workplace stress and pressures on medical staff.","School of Computing, Electronics and Maths"

The difficulty in fully collecting the required information related to student’s financial status and the imbalanced-data classification problem caused by the small proportion of poverty-stricken students among total students makes it a challenging problem.  This problem results in a heavy workload for the college staff to identify poverty-stricken students, determine the amount of corresponding subsidy, and execute the supporting polices in an efficient way. Therefore, this paper attempts to address the above-mentioned challenges by proposing a smart campus system, which makes use of campus big data to identify poverty-stricken students and support the decision-making on the subsidy for them. The proposed system can also alert the counselors to provide psychological support for  students in trouble. The major contributions of this research are as follows. Firstly, in addition to the features of students’ amount of consumption on campus and its statistical characteristics used in existing researches, this paper proposes new features that describe diversity of consumable commodities, preference of consumption location and price, and characteristics of students’ campus activities. Secondly, in order to solve the problem of dataset imbalance, four imbalanced data processing methods (Subsampling, Resampling, Costsensitive learning and SMOTE) have been applied to produce four different experimental datasets, and five classification algorithms (Random Forest, J48, Naïve Bayes, SMO, Logistic regression) have been used to train the classification model on each dataset. The experimental results indicate that the model based on Resampling and Random Forest achieves the best performance in F1-measure of poverty-stricken students, among the combinations of four imbalanced processing methods and five classification algorithms. In addition, a method of quantization of subsidies, and strategies of early warning and counseling for students are also described in this paper. A system was developed based on the above-mentioned methods, which meets the needs of individualized and diversified support for poverty-stricken students. The methods and the proposed system have been put into practice, and it is serving more than 17,000 students. The system has significantly improved the efficiency and quality of student management, and reduced the workload of college staff","School of Computing, Electronics and Maths"

As Long Range (LoRa) is currently one of the most prominent LPWA technologies, we propose in this paper a stochastic-geometry-based framework to analyse the uplink transmission performance of a multi-gateway LoRa network modelled by a Matern Cluster Process (MCP). The proposed model is first to consider all together the multi-cell topology, imperfect spreading factor (SF) orthogonality, random start times, and geometric data arrival rates. Accounting for all of these factors, we initially develop the SF-dependent collision overlap time function for any start time distribution. Then, we analyse the Laplace transforms of intra-cluster and inter-cluster interference, and formulate the uplink transmission success probability. Through simulation results, we highlight the vulnerability of each SF to interference, illustrate the impact of parameters such as the network density, and the power allocation scheme on the network performance. Uniquely, our results shed light on when it is better to activate adaptive power mechanisms, as we show that an SF-based power allocation that approximates LoRa ADR, negatively impacts nodes near the cluster head. Moreover, we show that the interfering SFs degrading the performance the most depend on the decoding threshold range and the power allocation scheme. ","School of Computing, Electronics and Maths"

Support vector machines (SVMs) are considered as efficient supervised learning approaches for classification due to their robustness against several types of model misspecifications and outliers. Kernel-based SVMs are known to be more flexible tools for a wide range of supervised learning tasks and can efficiently handle non-linear relationship between input variables and outputs (or labels). They are more robust with respect to the aforementioned model misspecifications, and also more accurate in the sense that the root-mean-square error computed by fitting the kernel-based SVMs is considerably smaller than the one computed by fitting the standard/linear SVMs. However, the choice of kernel type and particularity kernel’s parameters could have significant impact on the classification accuracy and other supervised learning tasks required in network security, Internet of things, cybersecurity, etc. One of the findings of this study is that larger kernel parameter(s) would encourage SVMs with more localities and vice versa. This chapter provides some results on the effect of the kernel parameter on the kernel-based SVM classification. We thus first examine the effect of these parameters on the classification results using the kernel-based SVM, and then specify the optimal value of these parameters using cross-validation (CV) technique.","School of Computing, Electronics and Maths"

The main features of the studied LPWA network are different transmission times-on-air, multiple uplink transmission attempts, and duty cycle restrictions. The aim of this work is to maximize the time-averaged sum of the uplink transmission rates by optimizing the transmission time-on-air allocation, the energy harvesting time allocation and the power allocation; subject to a maximum transmit power and to the availability of the harvested energy. We propose a low complex solution which decouples the optimization problem into three sub-problems: we assign the LPWA node transmission times (using either the fair or unfair approaches), we optimize the energy harvesting (EH) times using a one-dimensional search method, and optimize the transmit powers using a concave-convex (CCCP) procedure. In the simulation results, we focus on Long Range (LoRa) networks as a practical example LPWA network. We validate our proposed solution and we observe a $15\%$ performance improvement when using NOMA. ","School of Computing, Electronics and Maths"

The proposed topology offers an optimised DC source utilisation, reduced switch count and curtailment of active switches in the conduction path for minimising power losses. It can produce almost twice the number of output voltage steps in comparison to the cascaded H-bridge, hence named level-doubling architecture, and can be operated as both symmetric and asymmetric CMLIs. Identical modules of proposed CMLI precludes requirement of a variety of semiconductors and provides ease for spare management. The modular design also facilitates mass production and enhances system reliability. Furthermore, the proposed topology can be easily extended to high-voltage applications. The proposed design is tested for its practicability by simulations in MATLAB/ Simulink and results are verified by experimental set up of a scaled prototype single-phase model.","School of Computing, Electronics and Maths"

Since a series of studies have been published over the years regarding condition monitoring and fault diagnostics of these machines, it is essential to reach a common ground on why - sometimes - different techniques render different results. In this context, an investigation is provided with regards to the optimal window that should be adopted for the implementation of a proper time-frequency analysis of the monitored signals. On this agenda, this study attempts to set lower and upper bound limits for proper windowing from the digital signal processing point of view. This is done by proposing a formula for the lower limit, which is derived according to the specific frequencies one desires to put under inspection and which are the fault-related signatures. Finally, a discussion on the upper bound is put onwards; results from finite-element simulations are examined with the discussed approach in both the transient regime and the steady state, while experimental results verify the simulations with satisfying accuracy.","School of Computing, Electronics and Maths"

One of the most characteristic symptoms of PD is resting tremor. Local Field Potentials (LFPs) have been widely studied to investigate deviations from the typical patterns of healthy brain activity. However, the inherent dynamics of the Sub-Thalamic Nucleus (STN) LFPs and their spatiotemporal dynamics have not been well characterized. In this work, we study the non-linear dynamical behaviour of STN-LFPs of Parkinsonian patients using ε -recurrence networks. RNs are a non-linear analysis tool that encodes the geometric information of the underlying system, which can be characterised (for example, using graph theoretical measures) to extract information on the geometric properties of the attractor. Results show that the activity of the STN becomes more non-linear during the tremor episodes and that ε -recurrence network analysis is a suitable method to distinguish the transitions between movement conditions, anticipating the onset of the tremor, with the potential for application in a demand-driven deep brain stimulation system.","School of Computing, Electronics and Maths"

It has previously been shown that blow up is only possible when the exponent in the second-order term is above a certain critical value (dependent on the exponent in the fourth-order term). We show that in the limit that the critical value is approached from above, the primary branch of similarity profiles exhibits a well-defined structure consisting of a peak near the origin, and a thin, algebraically decaying tail, connected by an inner region equivalent (to leading order) to a generalised version of the Landau–Levich ‘drag-out’ problem in lubrication flow. Matching between the regions ultimately gives the asymptotic relationship between a parameter representing the height of the peak and the distance from the criticality threshold. The asymptotic results are supported by numerical computations found using continuation.","School of Computing, Electronics and Maths"

Our analysis benefits from the currently existing quite accurate estimates of the relevant (tri)critical-point locations. In all studied cases, the numerical results verify to a level of high accuracy the expected scenarios derived from analytic free-energy scaling arguments. We also investigate the size dependence of the interfacial adsorption under the presence of quenched bond randomness at the originally first-order transition regime (disorder-induced continuous transition) and the relevant self-averaging properties of the system. For this ex-first-order regime, where strong transient effects are shown to be present, our findings support the scenario of a non-divergent scaling, similar to that found in the original second-order transition regime of the pure model.","School of Computing, Electronics and Maths"

Recent papers have suggested a shift from VM and Container based deployments to a shared environment among applications to better utilize resources. Unfortunately, the existing deployment and optimization methods pay little attention to developing and identifying complete models to such systems which may cause large inaccuracies between simulated and physical run-time parameters. Existing models do not account for application interdependence or the locality of application resources which causes extra communication and processing delays. This paper addresses these issues by carrying out experiments in both cloud and edge systems with various scales and applications. It analyses the outcomes to derive a new reference model with data driven parameter formulations and representations to help understand the effect of migration on these systems. As a result, we can have a more complete characterization of the fog environment. This, together with tailored optimization methods than can handle the heterogeneity and scale of the fog can improve the overall system run-time parameters and improve constraint satisfaction. An Industry 4.0 based case study with different scenarios was used to analyze and validate the effectiveness of the proposed model. Tests were deployed on physical and virtual environments with different scales. The advantages of the model based optimization methods were validated in real physical environments. Based on these tests, we have found that our model is 90% accurate on load and delay predictions for application deployments in both cloud and edge.","School of Computing, Electronics and Maths"

A number of techniques, including multiple-input-multiple-output (MIMO) system, are investigated to increase the data rate. The high-speed optical MIMO system suffers from both spatial and temporal cross talks. The spatial cross-talk is often compensated by the MIMO decoding algorithm, while the temporal cross talk is mitigated using an equalizer. However, the LEDs have a non-linear transfer function and the performance of linear equalizers are limited. In this letter, we propose a joint spatial and temporal equalization using an artificial neural network (ANN) for an MIMO-VLC system. We demonstrate using a practical imaging/non-imaging optical MIMO link that the ANN-based joint equalization outperforms the joint equalization using a traditional decision feedback as ANN is able to compensate the non-linear transfer function as well as cross talk.","School of Computing, Electronics and Maths"

Based on mathematical models, this investigation explores the complex relationship between some of the mechanisms controlling physical activity and behaviour. In order to analyse the system control mechanisms, heart rate, volume of oxygen consumption and power output were measured for a well-trained male cyclist.

The mining process may be time consuming for massive datasets. A widely used method related to knowledge discovery domain refers to association rule mining (ARM) approach, despite its shortcomings in mining large databases. As such, several approaches have been prescribed to unravel knowledge. Most of the proposed algorithms addressed data incremental issues, especially when a hefty amount of data are added to the database after the latest mining process. Three basic manipulation operations performed in a database include add, delete, and update. Any method devised in light of data incremental issues is bound to embed these three operations. The changing threshold is a long-standing problem within the data mining field. Since decision making refers to an active process, the threshold is indeed changeable. Accordingly, the present study proposes an algorithm that resolves the issue of rescanning a database that had been mined previously and allows retrieval of knowledge that satisfies several thresholds without the need to learn the process from scratch. The proposed approach displayed high accuracy in experimentation, as well as reduction in processing time by almost two-thirds of the original mining execution time.","School of Computing, Electronics and Maths"

However, even with an in-home display (IHD), the benefits of a smart meter to a domestic customer are limited by the so-called ‘double invisibility’ of energy [1] and the standardisation of IHD design for an imagined home ‘micro-resource manager’ [2]. Furthermore, low-income households may be limited in the benefits they can reap from such systems; already living within a tight budget, suggestions for further energy-related cost savings may be detrimental to their health and wellbeing. This makes it important that the impact of actions taken to save energy is communicated. This can be done using indoor environmental measures, including carbon dioxide, relative humidity and temperature, as part of an integrated meter and sensor system (IMSS) and an associated IHD or digital application. Such a system gives users the ability to make informed decisions about their energy use and indoor environmental health. This paper explores the potential barriers to implementing an IMSS in practice. It explains how an IMSS was designed, based on a review of meter and sensor systems; details the process is taken to trial the IMSS in 19 social housing properties in the English Midlands; and makes recommendations for a larger scale rollout of IMSSs. The paper also reviews current progress in cloud storage and security as relevant to IMSSs and smart metering.","School of Energy, Construction and Environment,School of Computing, Electronics and Maths"

We propose to extend the application of minimax filtering from state estimation in the radio frequency (RF) domain to intruder tracking using VLC. The performance of the proposed method was examined and compared with Kalman filter for both VLC and RF. The simulation results showed that the minimax filter provided marginally better tracking and was more robust to the adversary behavior of the intruder than Kalman filter, with less than 0.5 cm estimation error. In addition, minimax was significantly better than Kalman filter for RF tracking applications.","School of Computing, Electronics and Maths"

This fills a longstanding gap in the literature on the horizontal visibility approach to nonlinear time series analysis which, despite a suite of successful applications across multiple domains, lacks a formal setting in which to prove general properties and develop natural extensions. The main finding is that horizon visibility graphs are dual to merge trees arising naturally over a filtered complex associated to a time series, while horizontal visibility graphs are weak duals of these trees. Immediate consequences include availability of tree-based reconstruction theorems, connections to results on the statistics of self-similar trees, and relations between visibility graphs and the emerging field of applied persistent homology.","School of Computing, Electronics and Maths"

The detection via the analysis of the stator current becomes challenging when the rotor cage suffers from multiple breakages at non-adjacent positions. In that case, electromagnetic asymmetries induced by the broken bars can be masked in such a way, that the diagnostic ability is highly likely to be obscured, thus leading to misinterpretation of the monitored signals’ signatures. A new approach is proposed in this work to overcome this problem while the motor is at steady state. In this paper, an industrial 6.6kV, 1.1MW induction motor is simulated with Finite Element Analysis (FEM) and its electromagnetic variables are analysed and studied under healthy state and several faulty conditions. The analysis of the stator current and stray flux waveforms is executed in both the transient and the steady state and aims to diagnose the challenging cases where the rotor breakages are nonconsecutive with regards to their spatial location. The results show the potential of flux analysis to fault severity regardless of the spatial position of the broken bars.","School of Computing, Electronics and Maths"

We propose two modified deep convolutional neural networks (DCNNs) termed single channel DopNet (SC-DopNet) and multiple channel DopNet (MC-DopNet) for mono-static and multi-static micro-Doppler signature ( mu -DS) classification. Differentiating armed and unarmed walking personnel is challenging due to the effect of the aspect angle and the channel diversity in real-world scenarios. In addition, the DCNN easily overfits the relatively small-scale mu -DS dataset. To address these problems, the work carried out in this paper makes three key contributions. First, two effective schemes including a data augmentation operation and a regularization term are proposed to train the SC-DopNet from scratch. Next, a factor analysis of the SC-DopNet is conducted based on various operating parameters in both the processing and radar operations. Third, to solve the problem of aspect angle diversity for the mu -DS classification, we design the MC-DopNet for multi-static mu -DS which is embedded with two new fusion schemes termed as greedy importance reweighting (GIR) and ell-{21} -Norm. These two schemes are based on two different strategies and have been evaluated experimentally. The GIR uses a win by sacrificing worst case approach, whereas ell -{21} -Norm adopts a win by sacrificing best case approach.

It is important to develop energy-efficient CNC machining strategies to achieve the overall goal of sustainable manufacturing. Due to the complexity of machining parameters, it is challenging to develop effective modelling and optimisation approaches to implement energy-efficient CNC machining. To address the challenge, in this paper, BS EN24T alloy (AISI 4340) has been used as a case study to conduct energy-efficient analysis and optimisation. Using a combination of experimentation and Taguchi analysis, the impact of the key machining parameters of CNC machining processes on energy consumption has been investigated in detail. A multi-objective optimisation model has been formulated, and a novel improved multi-swarm Fruit Fly optimisation algorithm (iMFOA) has been developed to identify optimal solutions. Case studies and algorithm benchmarking have been conducted to validate the effectiveness of the optimisation approach. The relationships between energy consumption and key machining parameters (e.g., cutting speed, feed per tooth, engagement depth) have been analysed to support process planners in implementing energy-saving measures efficiently. The optimisation approach developed is effective in fine-tuning key parameters for enhancing energy efficiency while meeting other technical requirements of production.","School of Computing, Electronics and Maths"

Socially assistive robots are now able to perform a number of tasks autonomously and without human supervision. However, if these robots are to be accepted by human users, there is a need to focus on the form of human–robot interaction that is seen as acceptable by such users. In this paper, we extend our previous work, originally presented in Ruiz-Garcia et al. (in: Engineering applications of neural networks: 17th international conference, EANN 2016, Aberdeen, UK, September 2–5, 2016, proceedings, pp 79–93, 2016. https://doi.org/10.1007/978-3-319-44188-7_6), to provide emotion recognition from human facial expressions for application on a real-time robot. We expand on previous work by presenting a new hybrid deep learning emotion recognition model and preliminary results using this model on real-time emotion recognition performed by our humanoid robot. The hybrid emotion recognition model combines a Deep Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) for self-learnt feature extraction and a Support Vector Machine (SVM) for emotion classification. Compared to more complex approaches that use more layers in the convolutional model, this hybrid deep learning model produces state-of-the-art classification rate of 96.26 % , when tested on the Karolinska Directed Emotional Faces dataset (Lundqvist et al. in The Karolinska Directed Emotional Faces—KDEF, 1998), and offers similar performance on unseen data when tested on the Extended Cohn–Kanade dataset (Lucey et al. in: Proceedings of the third international workshop on CVPR for human communicative behaviour analysis (CVPR4HB 2010), San Francisco, USA, pp 94–101, 2010).

Keeping focus on all these points, this article first shows security vulnerabilities of the multi-server cloud environment of the protocols proposed by Xue et al. and Chuang et al. Then, we propose an architecture which is applicable for distributed cloud environment and based on it, an authentication protocol using smartcard has been proposed, where the registered user can access all private information securely from all the private cloud servers. To proof security strength of our protocol, we have used AVISPA tool and BAN logic model in this article. In addition, informal cryptanalysis confirms that the protocol is protected against all possible security threats.

The energy consumption density (ECD), as a measure of end energy use in a unit area, was estimated and mapped by linking building floorspace data with residents’ energy use indicators such as per capita energy consumption, household energy expenditure, and mobility (transportation) pattern. This study also evaluated the ECD modelling outputs, and their sensitivity to distance from central business district (CBD) and total building floorspace.

Ideally, single photon avalanche detectors (SPADs) could be used to create more sensitive receivers. However, the dead time, finite output pulse width, and photon detection efficiency of existing SPAD arrays limit their sensitivity and bandwidth. In this paper, an accurate equation for the impact of dead time on the sensitivity of a SPAD array is presented. In addition, the impact of the width of the output pulses on the on-off keying data rate is investigated. Finally, a comparison between receivers containing an avalanche photo-diode (APD) and a large array of SPADs shows that although the receiver containing the SPAD is more sensitive in the dark, the APD-based receiver is more sensitive in a normal operating condition. However, the models that predict the performance of both receivers suggest that newer SPAD arrays will enable significant improvements in receiver sensitivity.","School of Computing, Electronics and Maths"

The fuzzy technique is evaluated in terms of its ability to model affective states in comparison to other existing machine learning approaches. The performance of the proposed affect modeling methodology is tested through the deployment of a personalised learning system, and series of offline and online experiments. A hybrid cloud intelligence infrastructure is used to conduct large-scale experiments to analyze user sentiments and associated emotions, using data from a million Facebook users. A performance analysis of the infrastructure on processing, analyzing, and data storage has been carried out, illustrating its viability for large-scale data processing tasks.

The main challenge is when containers of a different size, type, or weight need to be stored in a yard that holds a number of pre-existing containers. This challenge becomes even more complex when the date and time for the departure of the containers are unknown, as is the case when the container is collected by a third-party logistics company without any prior notice being given. The aim of this study is to develop a new system for the management of container yard operations,that takes into consideration a number of factors and constraints that occur in a real-life situation. One of these factors is the duration of stay for the topmost containers of each stack, when the containers are stored. Because the,duration of stay for containers in a yard varies dynamically over time, an ‘ON/OFF’ strategy is proposed to activate/deactivate the duration of stay factor constraint if the length of stay for these containers varies signiﬁcantly over,time. A number of tools and techniques are utilised for developing the proposed system including: discrete event simulation for the modelling of container storage and retrieval operations, a fuzzy know ledge-based model for,the stack allocation of containers, and a heuristic algorithm called ‘neighbourhood’ for the container retrieval operation. Results show that by adopting the proposed ‘ON/OFF’ strategy, 5% of the number of re-handlings, 2.5% of the total retrieval time, 6.6% of the total re-handling time and,42% of the average waiting time per truck are reduced.","School of Mechanical, Aerospace and Automotive Engineering,School of Computing, Electronics and Maths"

Typically, visible sensors have been utilized for this purpose. Recently, thermal sensors system or combination of visual and thermal sensors have been employed for pedestrian detection with advanced detection algorithm. DNNs have provided promising results for improving the accuracy of pedestrian and cyclist detection. This is because they are able to extract features at higher levels than typical hand-crafted detectors. Previous studies have shown that amongst the several sensor fusion techniques that exist, Halfway Fusion has provided the best results in terms of accuracy and robustness.

The featured isotropic material properties along with the Wide Band Gap (WBG) characteristics make it an excellent choice for power Metal Oxide Semiconductor Field Effect Transistors (MOSFETs). Nonetheless, material related limitations originate from the advantageous fact that 3C-SiC can be grown on Silicon (Si) wafers. One of these major limitations is an almost negligible activation of the p-type dopants after ion implantation because the annealing has to take place at relatively low temperatures. In this paper, a novel process flow for a vertical 3C-SiC-on-Si MOSFET is presented,to overcome the difficulties that currently exist in obtaining a p-body region through implantation.

Using the Carreau model for a range of shear-thinning and shear-thickening fluids, we determine, for the first time, steady-flow profiles under the partial-slip model for surface roughness. The subsequent linear stability analyses of these flows (to disturbances stationary relative to the disk) indicate that isotropic and azimuthally-anisotropic (radial grooves) surface roughness leads to the stabilisation of both shear-thinning and -thickening fluids. This is evident in the behaviour of the critical Reynolds number and growth rates of both Type I (inviscid cross flow) and Type II (viscous streamline curvature) modes of instability.

We compared games played on touchscreen, with the same games played on two other platforms: console and PC. We measured three dependent variables related to gamer experience: ease of controls, ease of task completion, and satisfaction. We found that the value of touchscreens for gamer experience depends on the interaction of three factors: characteristics of players (their gaming background and preferences); types of games (their genre and design); and platform (their controls and affordances).

However, it has a worst case complexity doubly exponential in the size of the input, which is often encountered in practice. It has been observed that for many problems a change in algorithm settings or problem formulation can cause huge differences in runtime costs, changing problem instances from intractable to easy. A number of heuristics have been developed to help with such choices, but the complicated nature of the geometric relationships involved means these are imperfect and can sometimes make poor choices. We investigate the use of machine learning (specifically support vector machines) to make such choices instead. Machine learning is the process of fitting a computer model to a complex function based on properties learned from measured data. In this paper we apply it in two case studies: the first to select between heuristics for choosing a CAD variable ordering; the second to identify when a CAD problem instance would benefit from Gröbner Basis preconditioning. These appear to be the first such applications of machine learning to Symbolic Computation. We demonstrate in both cases that the machine learned choice outperforms human developed heuristics.","School of Computing, Electronics and Maths"

Despite this exceptional response, more effort is needed to completely achieve the UNAIDS targets. Here, we conducted a detailed spatial analysis of the geographical structure of the HIV epidemic in Zimbabwe to include geographical prioritization as a key component of their overall HIV intervention strategy.Methods:Data were obtained from Zimbabwe Demographic and Health Survey (ZDHS) conducted in 2015 as well as estimations from the Zimbabwe Population-Based HIV Impact Assessment (ZIMPHIA) 2016 report, and other published literature. Data were used to produce high-resolution maps of HIV prevalence. Using these maps combined with the population density maps, we mapped the HIV-infected population lacking ART coverage and viral suppression.Results:HIV maps for both sexes illustrated similar geographical variation of HIV prevalence within the country. HIV-infected populations lacking ART coverage and viral suppression were concentrated in the main cities and urban settlements such as Bulawayo, Harare, Ruwa and Chitungwiza.Conclusion:Our study showed extensive local variation in HIV disease burden across Zimbabwe for both women and men. The high-resolution maps generated here identified areas wherein high density of HIV-infected individuals are lacking ART coverage and viral suppression.

Consequences of poor surface quality incur re-processing and higher wastes generating negative impacts on production costs and profitability. The complex relationships between surface quality and machining parameters could overwhelm machinists’ capabilities to correctly select machining parameters to produce satisfied quality of machined workpieces. This paper presents a novel approach of designing an intelligent supervision controller for real-time adjustments on feed rate and spindle speed to achieve desired surface quality of machined workpieces. The controller is an innovative model-based closed-loop system, consisting of a surface roughness prediction model and a multi-variable controller, to ensure real-time improvements on surface quality during machining processes. A case study based on milling processes for BS EN24T steel alloy has been used for testing and validating the approach. Simulation results show that the controller significantly reduced the difference between required and predicted surface roughness from 3.6 μm (based on planned parameters) to 0.12 μm (after the supervision controller adjustments). The results demonstrate that the proposed approach can effectively support high-quality machining processes.","School of Computing, Electronics and Maths"

It is estimated that about 10% of English households live in fuel poverty. During 2015 UK greenhouse gas emission final figures show that the net CO2 emission was reduced by 4.1% between 2014 and 2015. This shows that the UK is on course to attain its second carbon budget with annual 2013–2015 emissions that are each below the estimated level for the period. However, the housing sector lags with a 4% increase in emissions over the same period. More work needs to be done in this sector. Householders can adopt more efficient energy use approaches and make better lifestyle choices to save money and have a safer environment.,This research addresses government priorities to reduce energy demand, meet CO2 reduction targets, and reduce domestic reliance on fossil fuels, offering protection from price risks and fuel poverty as well as providing more affordable and comfortable domestic environments.,The proposed research paper deals with novel interaction methods on energy use in social housing and how the aforesaid issues can be reflected on. A detailed background study on existing interaction methods and ongoing development of a serious game trialled in 19 households has been carried out. It has been noted that displaying real-time utility use and indoor environmental conditions to householders increased awareness and impacted how energy is being consumed. Furthermore, the proposed paper will investigate end use energy profile pattern changes due to novel interaction methods.","School of Computing, Electronics and Maths,School of Energy, Construction and Environment"

However, the end-goal of retention differs between entertainment and serious contexts. For an entertainment game, engagement and retention is linked to monetization; for a serious game, this needs to persist for as long as is required for learning or behavioural objectives to be met. User engagement is strongest when a balance is achieved between difficulty and skill, leading to a state of “flow”. Hence adapting difficulty could lead to increased and sustained engagement. Implementing this requires the identification of variables linked to mechanics, manipulated based upon a player performance model. In some cases, this is possible by adjusting simple properties of objects, though more comprehensive solutions require extending or adapting content applying procedural techniques. This paper proposes a six step plan, validated against two case studies: an existing serious game, with easily-manipulated parameters, and a platformer game built from scratch, where additional content is required, showing the process for different mechanics. To explore limitations, the results of two small-scale user evaluations with 45 users in total, are reported, contributing to the understanding of how adaptive difficulty might be implemented and received.","School of Computing, Electronics and Maths"

Informed decision making would certainly benefit from such predictions. Bayesian networks (BNs) and copulas are widely used for modeling numerous uncertain scenarios. Copulas, in particular, have attracted more interest due to their nice property of approximating the probability distribution of the data with heavy tail. Heavy tail data is frequently observed in financial applications. The standard multivariate copula suffer from serious limitations which made them unsuitable for modeling the financial data. An alternative copula model called the pair-copula construction (PCC) model is more flexible and efficient for modeling the complex dependence of financial data. The only restriction of PCC model is the challenge of selecting the best model structure. This issue can be tackled by capturing conditional independence using the Bayesian network PCC (BN-PCC). The flexible structure of this model can be derived from conditional independences statements learned from data. Additionally, the difficulty of computing conditional distributions in graphical models for non-Gaussian distributions can be eased using pair-copulas. In this paper, we extend this approach further using the minimum information vine model which results in a more flexible and efficient approach in understanding the complex dependence between multiple variables with heavy tail dependence and asymmetric features which appear widely in the financial applications.","School of Computing, Electronics and Maths"

These models were extensively shown to provide remarkable modeling of the simultaneous occurrence of multipath fading and shadowing phenomena in emerging wireless scenarios such as cellular, off-body and vehicle-to-vehicle communications. Furthermore, the algebraic representation of these models is rather tractable, which renders them convenient to handle both analytically and numerically. Based on this, the present contribution analyzes the ergodic capacity over the recently proposed κ-μ/inverse gamma composite fading channels, which were shown to characterize excellently multipath fading and shadowing in line-of-sight communication scenarios, including realistic vehicular communications. Novel analytic expressions are derived which are subsequently used in the analysis of the corresponding system performance. In this context, the offered results are compared with respective results from cases assuming conventional fading conditions, which leads to the development of numerous insights on the effect of the multipath fading and shadowing severity on the achieved capacity levels. It is expected that these results will be useful in the design of timely and demanding wireless technologies such as wearable, cellular and inter-vehicular communications.","School of Computing, Electronics and Maths"

Piechocki",Exploiting WiFi Channel State Information for Residential Healthcare Informatics,"Detection and interpretation of human behaviors has emerged as a challenging healthcare problem in areas such as assisted living and remote monitoring. Besides traditional approaches that rely on wearable devices and camera systems, WiFi based technologies are materialising as a promising solution for indoor monitoring and activity recognition. This is, in part, due to the pervasive nature of WiFi in residential settings such as homes and care facilities. Moreover, WiFi based sensing is unobtrusive and minimally impinges on privacy. Advanced signal processing techniques are able to accurately extract WiFi channel status information (CSI) using commercial off-the-shelf (COTS) devices or bespoke hardware. This includes phase variations, frequency shifts and signal levels. In this paper we describe a methodology that identifies Doppler shifts in the WiFi CSI, caused by human activities which take place in the signal coverage area. The technique is shown to recognize different types of human activities and behaviours, and subsequently facilitate applications in healthcare. Three experimental case studies based on empirical data are presented to illustrate the capabilities of WiFi CSI Doppler sensing in assisted living and residential care environments. We also discuss the potential opportunities and practical challenges for real-world scenarios. ,Publisher Statement: © 2018 IEEE. Personal use of this material is permitted.

Visual analysis using cameras can recognise actions in a complex scene, such as someones living room. However, although there the huge potential benefits and importance, specifically for health, cameras are not widely accepted because of privacy concerns. This paper recognises human activities using a sensor that retains privacy. The sensor is not only different by being thermal, but it is also of low resolution: 8x8 pixels. The combination of the thermal imaging, and the low spatial resolution ensures the privacy of individuals. We present an approach to recognise daily activities using this sensor based on a discrete cosine transform. We evaluate the proposed method on a state-of-the-art dataset and experimentally confirm that our approach outperforms the baseline method. We also introduce a new dataset, and evaluate the method on it. Here we show that the sensor is considered better at detecting the occurrence of falls and Activities of Daily Living.

The  apparatus  consists of a hemispherical fluid vessel heated in its centre by a protruding heating element of cylindrical  shape.  The  resulting  convection  that  develops  above  the  heater,  i.e.  within the TC, is shown to set in for critical Rayleigh numbers and wavenumbers respectively scaling  as $Ra_c∼E^{−4/3}$ and $a_c∼E^{−1/3} with  the  Ekman  ,number E.  Although  exhibiting the  same  exponents  as  for  plane  rotating  convection,  these  laws  reflect  much  larger convective   plumes   at   onset.   The   structure   and   dynamics   of   supercritical   plumes are   in   fact   closer   to   those   found   in   solid   rotating   cylinders   heated   from   below, suggesting  that  the  confinement  within  the  TC  induced  by  the  Taylor–Proudman constraint  influences  convection  in  a  similar  way  as  solid  walls  would  do.  There  is a  further  similarity  in  that  the  critical  modes  in  the  TC  all  exhibit  a  slow  retrograde precession  at  onset.  In  supercritical  regimes,  the  precession  evolves  into  a  thermal wind  with  a  complex  structure  featuring  retrograde  rotation  at  high  latitude  and  either,prograde  or  retrograde  rotation  at  low  latitude  (close  to  the  heater),  depending  on the  criticality  and  the  Ekman  number.  The  intensity  of  the  thermal  wind  measured by  the  Rossby  number $Ro$ scales  as $Ro'5.33(Ra^∗_q)^{0.51}$ with  the  Rayleigh  number based  on  the  heat  flux $Ra^∗_q ∈[10^{−9}, 10^{−6}]$. This  scaling  is  in  agreement  with  heuristic predictions  and  previous  experiments  where  the  thermal  wind  is  determined  by  the azimuthal  curl  of  the  balance  between  the  Coriolis  force  and  buoyancy.  Within  the range $Ra∈[2×10^7, 10^9]$ which  we  explored,  we  also  observe  a  transition  in  the  heat transfer  through  the  TC  from  a  diffusivity-free  regime  where $Nu~0.38 E^2 Ra^{1.58}$ to  a,rotation-independent  regime  where $Nu=0.2Ra^{0.33}.","School of Computing, Electronics and Maths"

The research was carried out with twelve lecturers from three different universities in the United Kingdom. The data was collected using interviews. The data showed that the variation in teachers’ description of their relationship with simulation-games in teaching management could be synthesized in a set of four different categories, ranging from simulation-games as “resource to improve the acquisition of content” to simulation-games as “a means to bear resemblance to reality”. The main conclusion is that there are two orientations in teachers’ approach to simulation-games: on the one hand, there are those who are interested in delivering some kind of learning goals through it. I called this teachers’ orientation instrumental. On the other hand, there are those for whom simulation-games promote a special kind of bond in students’ relationship which, in turn, help them achieve their learning goals.

Accounted for in different locations on the machine's peripheral area and with different measurement techniques, the stray flux provides valuable information for fault detection and identification.

The detection via the analysis of the stator current becomes challenging when the rotor cage suffers from multiple breakages at non-adjacent positions. In that case, electromagnetic asymmetries induced by the broken bars can be masked in such a way, that the diagnostic ability is highly likely to be obscured, thus leading to misinterpretation of the monitored signals’ signatures. A new approach is proposed in this work to overcome this problem while the motor is at steady state. In this paper an industrial 6.6kV, 1.1MW induction motor will be simulated with Finite Element Analysis and its electromagnetic variables will be analysed and studied under healthy state and several faulty conditions. The analysis of the stator current and stray flux waveforms is executed in both the transient and the steady state and aims to diagnose the challenging cases where the rotor breakages are non-consecutive with regards to their spatial location.","School of Mechanical, Aerospace and Automotive Engineering,School of Computing, Electronics and Maths"

The model is intended to enable water resource management practitioners to assess the likely impact of potential interventions in particular,catchment areas. It has been designed to be driven by seasonal catchment level forecasts of potential hydrological droughts based on innovative climate and groundwater models. The current version of the model is driven by reconstructed historical drought data for the Colne catchment in the East of England from 1995 to 2014. This provides a framework of five drought phases (Normal, Developing, Drought, Severe and Recovering) which are mapped to policy driven interventions such as increased provision of water efficiency technologies and temporary water-use bans. The model uses UK Census 2011 data to develop a synthetic household population that matches the sociodemographics of the catchment and it microsimulates (at the household level) the consequences of water efficiency interventions retrospectively (1995–2014). Demand estimates for reconstructed,drought histories demonstrate that the model is able to adequately estimate end-use water consumption. Also, the potential value of the model in supporting cost-benefit analysis of specific interventions is illustrated. We conclude by discussing future directions for the work.","School of Computing, Electronics and Maths"

This leads to self-induced inter-carrier interference (ICI) in the SEFDM signal, which requires more sophisticated detectors to retrieve the transmitted data. In previous work, iterative detectors (IDs) have been used to recover the SEFDM signal after processing a certain number of iterations, however, the sequential iterative process increases the processing time with the number of iterations, leading to throughput reduction. In this work, ID pipelining is designed and implemented in software defined radio (SDR) to reduce the overall system detection latency and improve the throughput. Thus, symbols are allocated into parallel IDs that have no waiting time as they are received. Our experimental findings show that throughput will improve linearly with the number of the paralleled ID elements, however, hardware complexity also increases linearly with the number of ID elements.","School of Computing, Electronics and Maths"

While these mappings only work for planar graphs, for example for systems with periodic boundary conditions in at most one direction, we suggest here an iterative windowing technique that allows one to determine ground states for fully periodic samples up to sizes similar to those for the open-periodic case. Based on these techniques, a large number of disorder samples are used together with a careful finite-size scaling analysis to determine the stiffness exponents and domain-wall fractal dimensions with unprecedented accuracy, our best estimates being $\theta = -0.2793(3)$ and $d_\mathrm{f} = 1.273\,19(9)$ for Gaussian couplings.

The model is intended to give accurate representation of cell thermal and electrical characteristics in response to current application, highlighting distributions of these parameters across the cell. It is also designed to be compact and,fast simulating. A generalized parameterization approach allows the model to be easily adaptable to different cell designs and chemistries. The model achieves this by combining a thermal model based on thermal laws, with an electrical equivalent circuit model, both populated by empirical data accessible through simple individual cell testing. In this paper, the model is explained, and,simulation results are correlated against a Nickel Manganese Cobalt (NMC)/graphite cell cycled under constant current and also dynamic conditions without cooling.

Tamayoa, Yasir Imtiaz Khan, Ahmed Jawad Qureshi, Mohamed Al-Hussein",Design of control panels for automated modular construction machines,"Modern modular construction demands high quality, cost-effective, and efficient production of components. These requirements have led to the emergence of offsite construction manufacturing, which necessitates the use of automated machines. Compared to traditional onsite methods, offsite modular construction has a positive impact on quality, safety, cost, and productivity. Methodologies exist in the design of automated modular construction machines. This automation consists of not only the machines but also the supportive electrical and pneumatic systems, which, regardless of the design approaches used for automated machines, can be applied to the design of their associated systems. To avoid costly design changes, there is a clear need for a systematic and iterative design methodology at the conceptual design stage. For the control panel, the conceptual design method introduced in this paper facilitates the subsequent computer-aided design to be performed at the detailed design stage. Integrated function modeling, combined with axiomatic design and design structure matrix, constitutes the conceptual design approach for the control panel. In this work, linear time complex algorithm is developed for automating the layout of the electrical devices and wiring connections in order to facilitate computer-aided design implementation in the detailed design phase. Furthermore, the control panel guidelines and standards that constitute the prior knowledge of the design process are embedded in the algorithm.","School of Computing, Electronics and Maths"

Based on the sensor measurements a modified map is created to be used for the exploration and path planning processes, taking into account the uncertainty via the calculation of the guaranteed visibility and guaranteed sensed area, where safe navigation can be ensured regardless of the pose-error. A switching navigation function is used to initially explore the space towards the target position, and afterwards, when the target is discovered to navigate the robot towards it.

However, research investigating teachers' STEM roles and professional development through participation in outreach activities is limited. This paper explores teachers' views of STEM activities, how they understand their role as primary facilitators and the impact of their STEM engagement on their professional development. STEM outreach provides distinct opportunities for situated and dialogic learning. STEM teachers' effectiveness in engaging students by demonstrating the importance and relevance of STEM subjects in the real world and engaging captivating STEM outreach partners not only supports students learning but also enhances their opportunities to develop their knowledge and skills. Semi structured interviews were conducted with eleven teachers from six different schools in the West Midlands, United Kingdom. The data reveals STEM facilitators become the 'face' of STEM to their pupils. The expertise, knowledge and partnerships STEM facilitators develop, broadens their capacity to deliver teaching imbued with real world applications and improve students' understanding of the range of new and upcoming careers available. Most importantly, participating in STEM outreach activities help teachers maintain and reinforce their own sense of identity as STEM professionals. Outreach activities provide opportunities for teachers to interact with leading scientists and obtain exposure to cutting-edge research.

It regulates a wide range of processes throughout the plant. Synthetic auxins exploit the auxin-signalling pathway and are valuable as herbicidal agrochemicals. Currently, despite a diversity of chemical scaffolds all synthetic auxins have a carboxylic acid as the active core group. By applying bio-isosteric replacement we discovered that indole-3-tetrazole was active by surface plasmon resonance (SPR) spectrometry, showing that the tetrazole could initiate assembly of the TIR1 auxin co-receptor complex. We then tested the tetrazole's efficacy in a range of whole plant physiological assays and in protoplast reporter assays which all confirmed auxin activity, albeit rather weak. We then tested indole-3-tetrazole against the AFB5 homologue of TIR1, finding that binding was selective against TIR1, absent with AFB5. The kinetics of binding to TIR1 are contrasted to those for the herbicide picloram, which shows the opposite receptor preference as it binds to AFB5 with far greater affinity than to TIR1. The basis of the preference of indole-3-tetrazole for TIR1 was revealed to be a single residue substitution using molecular docking, and assays using tir1 and afb5 mutant lines confirmed selectivity in vivo. Given the potential that a TIR1-selective auxin might have for unmasking receptor-specific actions, we followed a rational design, lead optimisation campaign and a set of chlorinated indole-3-tetrazoles was synthesised. Improved affinity for TIR1 and the preference for binding to TIR1 was maintained for 4-and 6-chloroindole-3-tetrazoles, coupled with improved efficacy in vivo. This work expands the range of auxin chemistry for the design of receptor-selective synthetic auxins.","School of Computing, Electronics and Maths"

Therefore, critical universality, which is a perturbative renormalization-group prediction, holds beyond the validity regime of perturbation theory. Most notably, dimensional reduction is restored at five dimensions, i.e., the exponents of the random-field Ising model at five dimensions and those of the pure Ising ferromagnet at three dimensions are the same.","School of Computing, Electronics and Maths"

In this paper,  an investigation on scattering regimes for underwater links using Monte Carlo simulation has been presented.While the focus of this paper is on diffuse links, the simulation results of collimated links is also provided for comparison purpose. Three types of water namely clear, coastal and turbid water are being used in the simulation. It is shown that the effect of scattering on the path loss cannot be accurately modeled by the existing channel model; ie. Beers-Lambert (BL) law.  It has been shown that  the distance at which the unscattered light drops to zero can be used to estimate the transition point for the scattering regimes in case of diffuse links. The transition point for diffuse links in coastal water and turbid water can be estimated to be around 22 m and 4 m respectively. Further analysis on the scattering order probability at different scattering regimes illustrates how scattering is affected by beam size, water turbidity and distance. From the frequency response plot, it is estimated that the bandwidth of several order of GHz can be achieved when the links are operating in the minimal scattering region and will reduce to several hundreds of MHz when the link is operating in multiple scattering region.","School of Computing, Electronics and Maths"

The system is shown to be in a Gaussian state (at all time t) and the average number of particles is shown to obey the chaos game equation. Considering bosonic operators, with a system initially prepared in coherent states, the evolution of the system can be tracked by investigating the dynamics of the eigenvalues of the annihilation operator.

Creditors could immensely benefit from such improvements in analysis hoping to minimise potential monetary losses. Analysis of real world financial scenarios require modeling of multiple uncertain quantities with a view to present more accurate, near future probabilistic predictions. Such predictions are essential for an informed decision making.

The authors demonstrate that the extended model based on minimum information Pair-Copula Construction (PCC) can approximate any non-Gaussian BN to any degree of approximation.

The type or condition of a playing surface has been empirically linked to injuries by players, yet injury research studies do not always support players’ assessments of injury risk. The purpose of this study was to analyse a worldwide cohort of elite football players’ perceptions of injuries due to a playing surface and to explore differences with the injury literature. The results can identify areas where future research should be focused to minimise the differences and ensure playing surfaces do not cause injuries perceived or otherwise. Both qualitative and quantitative data were collected from 1129 players across the globe to address the aim of this study. Ninety-one percent of players believed the type or condition of a surface could increase the risk of injury. Soreness and pain were terms frequently used by players to describe the types of injuries they experienced and were often in relation to muscles or joints/bones. Abrasive injuries, along with soreness and pain were perceived to be greater on artificial turf. Surface type, surface properties, footwear, player attributes, adaptation and climate/time of the season were all potential risk factors identified by the players and linked to the playing surfaces. The results of this study suggest injury reporting should include measures of soreness or pain experienced by players. Potential risk factors such as switching between surfaces require further experimental studies to support the players’ perceptions from varying surface experiences.","School of Computing, Electronics and Maths"

Liquid-type viscosities are found to entrain both the velocity and temperature profiles closer to the plate with increasing temperature sensitivity; gas-type viscosities are found to exhibit the reverse effect. A linear stability analysis is presented and we find that increasing the temperature dependence of the fluid (from gas- to liquid-type behaviour) results in an increased critical Reynolds number to a point of maximum stability. Using an energy-balance approach, we determine that this behaviour is primarily driven by the inviscid instability of the modified steady flow, rather than being a result of modified viscous instability effects. Application and extension of the results are considered in the context of Chemical Vapour Deposition.","School of Computing, Electronics and Maths"

Due to the high degree of interdigitation of diode parts and Gate Commutated Thyristor (GCT) parts, it is necessary to investigate how to best separate the two and at the same time, how to maximise the individual power handling capability. This work underpins the latter, for the GCT part. In achieving that, this letter details the optimisation direction, identifies the design parameters that influence the Maximum Controllable Current (MCC) and thereafter introduces a new design attribute, the “pzone”. This new design not only improves the MCC at high temperature, but also at low temperature, yielding temperature independent current handling capability and at least 1000 A, or 23.5 % of improvement compared to the state-of-the-art. As a result, the proposed design constitutes an enabler for optimally designed bi-mode devices rated at least 5000 A for applications with the highest power requirement.","School of Computing, Electronics and Maths"

Compared to growing 4H-SiC on hexagonal SiC, growing 3C-SiC on Si wafers is quite cost-effective and has recently resulted in epitaxial layers with thickness capable of supporting voltages of this magnitude. In this work, the power law of 3C-SiC is derived for the first time towards predicting the breakdown voltage of vertical Schottky Barrier Diodes (SBDs) based on this wide bandgap (WBG) semiconductor material. To ensure the predicted blocking capabilities from the 3C-SiC power law expression will be supported to the largest extend in fabricated SBDs, termination topologies are adjusted and investigated by performing extensive Technology Computer Aided Design (TCAD) simulations. A comprehensive map is developed to allow the decision on the termination concept for 3C-SiC-on-Si SBDs to be made based on efficiency and area requirement criteria.","School of Computing, Electronics and Maths"

The BDFM is an attractive generator solution for offshore wind power and can replace doubly-fed slip-ring induction generators. It is shown in this paper that the use of magnetic wedges, commonly used in large induction machines, reduces the stator windings magnetising currents, reflected in the values of magnetising inductances. But they also increase the leakage flux of the stator windings and hence change the series inductance in the equivalent circuit. The series inductance significantly affects the machine performance as well as the rating of its converter. 2-D Finite element analysis of a 250 kW experimental BDFM is used to investigate the effects of magnetic wedges on the machine's magnetic field distribution and how these can alter the machine's parameters values. Experimental tests have also been carried out to validate the analysis.","School of Computing, Electronics and Maths"

We focus on hypercubic lattices embedded on tori, in dimensions one to three, with cluster fugacity at least one. We make a number of conjectures regarding the asymptotic behaviour of the coupling time, motivated by rigorous results in one dimension and Monte Carlo simulations in dimensions two and three. Amongst our findings, we observe that, for generic parameter values, the distribution of the appropriately standardized coupling time converges to a Gumbel distribution, and that the standard deviation of the coupling time is asymptotic to an explicit universal constant multiple of the relaxation time. Perhaps surprisingly, we observe these results to hold both off criticality, where the coupling time closely mimics the coupon collector’s problem, and also at the critical point, provided the cluster fugacity is below the value at which the transition becomes discontinuous. Finally, we consider analogous questions for the single-spin Ising heat-bath process.","School of Computing, Electronics and Maths"

Current research shows that full binarisation results in a degradation of accuracy and different approaches to tackle this issue are being investigated such as using more complex models as accuracy reduces. This paper proposes an alternative based on a multi-precision CNN frame-work that combines a binarised and a floating point CNN in a pipeline configuration deployed on heterogeneous hardware. The binarised CNN is mapped onto an FPGA device and used to perform inference over the whole input set while the floating point network is mapped onto a CPU device and performs re-inference only when the classification confidence level is low. A light-weight confidence mechanism enables a flexible trade-off between accuracy and throughput. To demonstrate the concept, we choose a Zynq 7020 device as the hardware target and show that the multi-precision network is able to increase the BNN accuracy from 78.5% to 82.5% and the CPU inference speed from 29.68 to 90.82 images/sec.","School of Computing, Electronics and Maths"

Here we outline the opportunities and challenges of massively parallel computing for Monte Carlo simulations in statistical physics, with a focus on the simulation of systems exhibiting phase transitions and critical phenomena. This covers a range of canonical ensemble Markov chain techniques as well as generalized ensembles such as multicanonical simulations and population annealing. While the examples discussed are for simulations of spin systems, many of the methods are more general and moderate modifications allow them to be applied to other lattice and off-lattice problems including polymers and particle systems. We discuss important algorithmic requirements for such highly parallel simulations, such as the challenges of random-number generation for such cases, and outline a number of general design principles for parallel Monte Carlo codes to perform well.","School of Computing, Electronics and Maths"

Brian’s victory is widely remembered for breaking Viking power in Ireland, although much modern scholarship disputes traditional perceptions. Instead of an international conflict between Irish and Viking, interpretations based on revisionist scholarship consider it a domestic feud or civil war. Counterrevisionists challenge this view and a long-standing and lively debate continues. Here, we introduce quantitative measures to the discussions.We present statistical analyses of network data embedded in the text to position its sets of interactions on a spectrum from the domestic to the international.

Three galaxy samples (slices) with redshifts ranging within intervals 0.88÷0.91, 0.91÷0.94 and 0.94÷0.97 are studied as two-dimensional projections for the spatial distributions of galaxies. We construct networks and calculate network measures for each sample, in order to analyse the network similarity of different samples, distinguish various topological environments, and find associations between galaxy properties (colour index and stellar mass) and their topological environments. Results indicate a high level of similarity between geometry and topology for different galaxy samples and no clear evidence of evolutionary trends in network measures. The distribution of local clustering coefficient C manifests three modes which allow for discrimination between stand-alone singlets and dumbbells (0 ≤ C ≤ 0.1), intermediately packed (0.1 < C < 0.9) and clique (0.9 ≤ C ≤ 1) like galaxies. Analysing astrophysical properties of galaxies (colour index and stellar masses), we show that distributions are similar in all slices, however weak evolutionary trends can also be seen across redshift slices. To specify different topological environments we have extracted selections of galaxies from each sample according to different modes of C distribution. We have found statistically significant associations between evolutionary parameters of galaxies and selections of C: the distribution of stellar mass for galaxies with interim C differ from the corresponding distributions for stand-alone and clique galaxies, and this difference holds for all redshift slices. The colour index realises somewhat different behaviour.","School of Computing, Electronics and Maths"

Further, they all can be phrased in prenex normal form with only existential quantifiers and so are also admissible to those Satisfiability Module Theory (SMT) solvers that support the QF_NRA.

In the event of AV incidents, ethical decisions will need to be made, e.g. a decision between colliding into one of three different AVs ahead on a multiple lane highway. A possible solution to the ethical problem is known as the utilitarian approach; this involves the AV steering into the collision path of least loss of utility, e.g. lowest injury level or number of fatalities. Deciding on the collision outcome of such ethical problems involves the investigation of a model-to-decision (M2D) approach. Thus, using a mathematical model of the collision scenarios to then make decisions based on the severity of each outcome as a measure of utility loss. This research investigates the use of such an approach for AVs in convoy on a three-lane highway. The mathematical model of an AV convoy collision that has been developed is of a nonlinear (bilinear) lumped mass spring configuration. This model is used in conjunction with a pragmatic multi-criteria decision maker (MCDM). The results from the M2D approach highlight the effectiveness of the utilisation approach on-board future AVs to minimise utility loss in terms of the severity of road traffic injuries and/or number of fatalities.","School of Mechanical, Aerospace and Automotive Engineering,School of Computing, Electronics and Maths"

During the collective exploration, the robots exchange their maps in a collaborative manner. If a robot detects the target that is assigned to another robot, it communicates this information to the corresponding robot and continues to explore its target. The other robot rather than performing exploration towards its already discovered target, it attempts to join its map with that of the reporting robot.

Once modelled, unusual activities may be detected that have the potential of impacting upon a person’s well-being. The use of Petri nets to model ADLs is considered in this research as a means to capture the intricate behaviours of ambient systems. To our best knowledge there has not been extensive work in the related literature, hence the novelty of this work. The ADLs considered in the developed Petri net model are: (i) preparing tea, (ii) preparing coffee, and (iii) preparing pasta. The first two ADLs listed are deemed to have many occurrences during a typical day of an elderly person. The third activity is representative of activities that involve cooking. Hence, abnormal behaviour detected in the context of these activities can be an indicator of a progressive health problem or the occurrence of a hazardous incident. The completion and noncompletion of activities are considered in the developed Petri net model and are also formally verified. The description of the sensor system of the kitchen ADLs, its Petri net model and verification results are presented. Results show that the Petri net modelling of ADLs can reliably and effectively reflect the real behaviour of the examined system detecting all the activities of the users that can exhibit both their normal and abnormal behaviour.","School of Computing, Electronics and Maths"

Despite the fact that many practical and theoretical algorithms have successfully attempted to provide Pareto optimal solutions, they have focused on attempting to reach Pareto Optimality using horizontal approaches, where optimality is calculated taking into account every participant at the same time. Sometimes, this may prove to be a difficult task (e.g., conflict, mistrust, no information sharing, etc.). In this paper, we explore the possibility of achieving Pareto Optimal outcomes in a group by using a bottom-up approach: discovering Pareto optimal outcomes by interacting in subgroups. We analytically show that the set of Pareto optimal outcomes in a group covers the Pareto optimal outcomes within its subgroups. This theoretical finding can be applied in a variety of scenarios such as negotiation teams, multi-party negotiation, and team formation to social recommendation. Additionally, we empirically test the validity and practicality of this proof in a variety of decision making domains and analyze the usability of this proof in practical situations.","School of Computing, Electronics and Maths"

Using the post-fault current time series, the frequency spectrum is generated for measuring the gaps between the contiguous peak frequencies. This method is able to locate the fault by analyzing the single-end fault current, which guarantees a faster response than using two-end data. The new gap-based approach is able to give accurate fault detection using any appropriate range of post-fault signal. Furthermore, the proposed method is fault resistance independent. A two-terminal VSC-HVDC system is modeled in PSCAD/EMTDC. The algorithm is verified by studying different cases of different fault resistances in various fault locations. The result shows that the proposed method gives an accurate and reliable fault location detection along DC transmission line. In addition, the proposed algorithm can be potentially used in other HVDC systems.","School of Computing, Electronics and Maths"

The reason for this interest is the machine's ability to operate as a brushless variable speed motor or generator through the use of a partially-rated power electronic converter connected to its second stator winding. Interest has increased in the last 20 years because of greater penetration of wind turbines with Doubly-Fed induction Generators (DFIGs) where brush gear and slip-ring maintenance and reliability have been a major issue. The BDFM appears in two forms, the brushless doubly fed induction machine (BDFIM), with two stator windings and a third closed rotor winding or the brushless doubly fed reluctance machine (BDFRM), with two stator windings and a reluctance rotor with no winding. This paper sets out to provide a rotor-centric view of BDFM operation, which shows the basis of its rotating flux pattern, aligning it with the known Natural Speed, and clarifying the synchronous and induction modes of operation of the BDFIM and the synchronous BDFRM. Based on rotor-centric view of the BDFM, it is shown that the conventional design methods for the BDFM stator back iron can be modified, leading to a lighter and smaller machine. The proposed design concepts are supported by analytical methods and their practicality is verified using 2-D Finite Element (FE) modeling and analysis of three experimental BDFMs.","School of Computing, Electronics and Maths"

In intrusion detection, the most important constraints are the imbalanced class distribution, the scarcity of the labeled data, and the massive amounts of network flows. Moreover, because of the dynamic nature of the network flows, applying static learned models degrades the detection performance significantly over time. In this article, we propose a new semi‐supervised stream classification method for intrusion detection, which is capable of incremental updating using limited labeled data. The proposed method, called the incremental semi‐supervised flow network‐based IDS (ISF‐NIDS), relies on an incremental mixed‐data clustering, a new supervised cluster adjustment method, and an instance‐based learning. The ISF‐NIDS operates in real time and learns new intrusions quickly using limited storage and processing power. The experimental results on the KDD99, Moore, and Sperotto benchmark datasets indicate the superiority of the proposed method compared with the existing state‐of‐the‐art incremental IDSs.","School of Computing, Electronics and Maths"

The nonlinear dynamics are much less sensitive to sheared flows than the average linear growthrates, and very small amplitude perturbations can lead to sustained turbulence. We explore the general problem of characterizing how and when the transition from near-laminar states to sustained turbulence occurs; a model of the interchange instability being used as a concrete example. These questions are fundamentally nonlinear, and the answers must go beyond the linear transient amplification of small perturbations. Two methods that account for nonlinear interactions are therefore explored here. The first method explored is edge tracking, which identifies the boundary between the basins of attraction of the laminar and turbulent states. Here, the edge is found to be structured around an exact, localized, traveling wave solution; a solution that is qualitatively similar to avalanche-like bursts seen in the turbulent regime. The second method is an application of nonlinear, non-modal stability theory which allows us to identify the smallest disturbances which can trigger turbulence (the minimal seed for the problem) and hence to quantify how stable the laminar regime is. The results obtained from these fully nonlinear methods provides confidence in the derivation of a semi-analytic approximation for the minimal seed. ","School of Computing, Electronics and Maths"

In this paper, a new energy management control method using 3 input parameters to a fuzzy logic controller is firstly proposed to deal with high fluctuating power demands. An example data processing result is shown in this paper. The results show that the hybrid storage system which applied fuzzy logic control has more flat battery charging/discharging current than an equivalent filtration control method. The low fluctuating battery demand is ideal for extending battery lifetime. Furthermore, the fuzzy logic controller can automatically adapt to the size of the SMES system by applying the state of the charge (SOC) of SMES as an input parameter to the fuzzy logic control.","School of Computing, Electronics and Maths"

While it is well established that bumblebees exploit urban green spaces, this is the first study to explore the land use and floral preferences of the UK’s seven most common bumblebees in gardens and allotments cultivated for food. A citizen science survey was carried out at 38 sites, between 1st June and 30th September 2013. At the landscape scale, bumblebee abundance and species richness was not significantly correlated with surrounding land use characteristics (both p > 0.05). Bombus pratorum was the only species to show correlations with surrounding land use, demonstrating a positive relationship with built areas and gardens and allotments, and a negative correlation with greenspace and agriculture. At the local site-level scale, bumblebee abundance was negatively correlated with areas cultivated for vegetables and fruits, and positively correlated with areas cultivated for flowers, although neither correlation was statistically significant (p = 0.070 and p = 0.051 respectively). Bumblebee species richness was not correlated with either land use (p > 0.05). All bumblebee species were negatively correlated with areas cultivated for vegetables and fruit, bare ground and hard paving. Several flowering plants were visited by all bumblebee species, although relative preferences varied between bumblebee species. Results emphasise the importance of including floral resources within garden and allotment areas cultivated for food, and the need for a mosaic of different flowering plants to cater for varying floral preferences demonstrated by bumblebee species.","School of Computing, Electronics and Maths"

Due to internal and external factors, risks affect individual network nodes and their impact propagates through the network to affect other nodes. A Fuzzy Dynamic Inoperability Input/output Model (FDIIM) is developed to facilitate and analyse the risk and its propagation in global production networks (GPN), at the strategic level. This method applies fuzzy arithmetic to track and operate with uncertainty in GPN parameters and to estimate the confidence in the results obtained. The expert provides a judgement on relevant risk parameters’ values in the form of linguistic values, where relevant statistical data is absent. We used the measure of ambiguity to measure uncertainty in the GPN parameters. Two types of analyses are carried out: (1) to examine the sensitivity of the FDIIM to changes in input parameter values, including interdependencies between GPN nodes, resilience of the GPN, intended revenues and impact of disruptions, and (2) to examine sensitivity to uncertainty in the GPN’s input parameters. A generic GPN example and different risk scenarios are defined to illustrate these analyses. The analyses provide an insight into the importance of different GPN’s parameters in the risk analysis. Furthermore, we demonstrated how to identify GPN parameters which are important to specify with less uncertainty.

Bike sharing systems have been proposed as an interesting solution to deal with these problems. Nevertheless, shared vehicle schemes also arise problems that must be addressed such as the vehicle distribution along time and across space in the city. Differently to classic approaches, we propose the architecture for a muti-agent system that tries to improve the efficiency of bike sharing systems by introducing user-driven balancing in the loop. The rationale is that of persuading users to slightly deviate from their origins/destinations by providing appropriate arguments and incentives, while optimizing the overall balance of the system. In this paper we present two of the proposed system’s modules. The first will allow us to predict bike demand in different stations. The second will score stations and alternative routes.

In this article, with a resource-oriented approach, enterprise data resources are represented as data-centric Web services, grouped on-demand of business requirement and configured dynamically to adapt to changing business processes. First, a configurable architecture CIRPA involving information resource pool is proposed to act as a scalable and dynamic platform to virtualise enterprise information resources as data-centric Web services. By exposing data-centric resources as REST services in larger granularities, tenant-isolated information resources could be accessed in business process execution. Second, dynamic information resource pool is designed to fulfil configurable and on-demand data accessing in business process execution. CIRPA also isolates transaction data from business process while supporting diverse business processes composition. Finally, a case study of using our method in logistics application shows that CIRPA provides an enhanced performance both in static service encapsulation and dynamic service execution in cloud computing environment.

The study of complex systems forms a new interdisciplinary research area that cuts across physics, biology, ecology, economics, sociology, and the humanities. In this paper we review the essence of complex systems from a physicists point of view, and try to clarify what makes them conceptually different from systems that are traditionally studied in physics. Our goal is to demonstrate how the dynamics of such systems may be conceptualised in quantitative and predictive terms by extending notions from statistical physics and how they can often be captured in a framework of co-evolving multiplex network structures. We mention three areas of complex-systems science that are currently studied extensively, the science of cities, dynamics of societies, and the representation of texts as evolutionary objects. We discuss why these areas form complex systems in the above sense. We argue that there exists plenty of new ground for physicists to explore and that methodical and conceptual progress is needed most.","School of Computing, Electronics and Maths"

This fundamental study is motivated in part by the desire to enhance heat transfer in the blanket ducts of nuclear fusion reactors. In pure magnetohydrodynamic flows, the imposed transverse magnetic field causes the flow to become quasi-two-dimensional and exhibit disturbances that are localized to the horizontal walls. However, the vertical temperature stratification in Rayleigh-Bénard flows feature convection cells that occupy the interior region, and therefore the addition of this aspect provides an interesting point for investigation. The linearized governing equations are described by the quasi-two-dimensional model proposed by Sommeria and Moreau [J. Fluid Mech. 118, 507 (1982)], which incorporates a Hartmann friction term, and the base flows are considered fully developed and one-dimensional. The neutral stability curves for critical Reynolds and Rayleigh numbers, Re c and Ra c, respectively, as functions of Hartmann friction parameter H have been obtained over 10−2 ≤ H ≤ 104. Asymptotic trends are observed as H → ∞ following Re c ∝ H 1/2  and Ra c ∝ H. The linear stability analysis reveals multiple instabilities which alter the flow both within the Shercliff boundary layers and the interior flow, with structures consistent with features from plane Poiseuille and Rayleigh-Bénard flows.","School of Computing, Electronics and Maths"

This range of   and   captures both steady-state two-dimensional flow solutions and the inception of unsteady two-dimensional flow.

The critical Reynolds number and the spanwise wavelength of perturbations increase as   increases. For   both the critical Reynolds number for onset of unsteadiness and the spanwise wavelength decrease as   increases. Finally, for   , the critical Reynolds number and spanwise wavelength remain almost constant.

The data was subjected to a two-stage statistical analysis procedure in R (R Core Team 2015). Stage 1: Chi-squared tests highlighted 15 categorical variables that were significantly (p<0.05) associated with final game outcome (winning versus losing). The category with the highest level of statistical significance was Match Status (p<0.001). Stage 2: The multicollinearity between explanatory categories were explored. Categories that demonstrated perfect collinearity were removed. Using a 70% sample of the data (4,288 possessions), a forward and backwards stepwise elimination approach was used to build a final model, which included seven categories comprising of 37 action variables: Match Status, Defensive Unit (3.0/3.5), Offensive Unit (3.0/3.5), Offensive Unit (4.0/4.5), Stage, Defensive System and Start of Possession. When tested against the remaining 30% data set an area under the curve value of 0.749 was achieved which suggests the model has ‘fair’ predictive qualities. The final model indicates the importance of maintaining a winning state throughout the game, selecting a unit which predominately comprises of three point players and countering when the defence are pressing. Coaches, players and support staff can utilise the findings from the study to assist with the planning of offensive and defensive game strategies by identifying areas for development within training sessions, supporting selection and line-up combinations and informing the decision-making process of coaches and players during performances.","School of Computing, Electronics and Maths"

In the heteroscedastic case, LDA is not guaranteed to minimise this error. Assuming heteroscedasticity, we derive a linear classifier, the Gaussian Linear Discriminant (GLD), that directly minimises the Bayes error for binary classification. In addition, we also propose a local neighbourhood search (LNS) algorithm to obtain a more robust classifier if the data is known to have a non-normal distribution. We evaluate the proposed classifiers on two artificial and ten real-world datasets that cut across a wide range of application areas including handwriting recognition, medical diagnosis and remote sensing, and then compare our algorithm against existing LDA approaches and other linear classifiers. The GLD is shown to outperform the original LDA procedure in terms of the classification accuracy under heteroscedasticity. While it compares favourably with other existing heteroscedastic LDA approaches, the GLD requires as much as 60 times lower training time on some datasets. Our comparison with the support vector machine (SVM) also shows that, the GLD, together with the LNS, requires as much as 150 times lower training time to achieve an equivalent classification accuracy on some of the datasets. Thus, our algorithms can provide a cheap and reliable option for classification in a lot of expert systems. ","School of Computing, Electronics and Maths"

It is estimated that about 10% of English households live in fuel poverty.2015 UK greenhouse gas emission final figures show that the net CO2 emission was reduced by 4.1% between 2014 and 2015. This shows that the UK is on course to attain its second carbon budget with annual 2013-2015 emissions that are each below the estimated level for the period. However, the housing sector lags with a 4% increase in emissions over the same period. More work needs to be done in this sector. Householders can adopt more efficient energy use approaches and make better lifestyle choices to save money and have a safer environment. This research addresses government priorities to reduce energy demand, meet CO2 reduction targets, and reduce domestic reliance on fossil fuels, offering protection from price risks and fuel poverty as well as providing more affordable and comfortable domestic environments. The proposed research paper deals with novel interaction methods on energy use in social housing and how the aforesaid issues can be reflected on. A detailed background study on existing interaction methods and ongoing development of a serious game trialled in 19 households has been carried out. It has been noted that displaying real-time utility use and indoor environmental conditions to householders increased awareness and impacted how energy is being consumed. Furthermore, the proposed paper will investigate end use energy profile pattern changes due to novel interaction methods (if any).","School of Energy, Construction and Environment,School of Computing, Electronics and Maths"

It is of vital significance to thermal characterise of PCM to obtain phase change temperature range and the relationship of specific heat capacity with temperature (Cp-T). This is simply done by using differential scanning calorimetry (DSC). Present paper highlights the importance of experimental heating rate in thermal characterisation of PCM. It has been observed that the heating/cooling rate plays an important factor in studying numerically the charging/discharging behaviour of a PCM. Firstly the recommended heating/cooling rate of 10 °C/min stated in ASTM D 4419 is used for the DSC, followed by the rate of 0.2 °C/min observed in the experimental testing. The phase change temperature range and the Cp-T curves have been determined for the both heating/cooling rates. An experimentally validated CFD model has been developed aiming to predict the thermal performance of PCM and the air outlet temperatures. The effective heat capacity method is applied including the Cp-T obtained from the DSC for both rates. Similar heating rate, as per experimental testing, established significant improvements in the validation results when applied in a CFD model.","School of Computing, Electronics and Maths,School of Energy, Construction and Environment"

Making decisions within a medical domain is difficult due to the existence of high levels of uncertainty. The sources of this uncertainty can be due to the variation of physicians' opinions and experiences. The structure of existing FCMs is based on type -1 fuzzy sets in order to represent the causal relations among concepts of the modeled system. Therefore, the ability of the FCM to handle high levels of uncertainties and deliver accurate results can be hindered. In this paper, we propose using the Interval Agreement Approach to model the weights of links in FCMs to capture high level uncertainties in the presence of imprecise data acquired from different medical experts to enhance its decision modelling and reasoning capability. The proposed model is used in identifying if a child is diagnosed with an Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) where the Modified Checklist for Autism in Toddlers is used as a standard tool to derive the inputs for the FCMs. Initial results demonstrate that the proposed method outperforms conventional FCMs in classifying ASD based on a dataset of diagnosed cases.","School of Computing, Electronics and Maths"

The sensor system operates in a differential mode with two SMR devices driven by Pierce oscillators. The active resonator was spray-coated with a selective polymer compound, while the second one was used as a reference. The absorption of vapor molecules into the polymer layer causes a frequency shift in the resonator. A study of suitable polymer coatings and finite element simulations on the sensor response were performed. Experimental results demonstrated that the VOC monitor is capable of detecting toluene concentrations down to 5 ppm with a high sensitivity of 60 Hz/ppm for a 180 nm PDMS polymer coated SMR resonating at 900 MHz. We believe that the system could be used as a robust, low-cost and low power microsensor for the real-time and ubiquitous monitoring of VOCs, particularly in a personal air quality monitor.","School of Computing, Electronics and Maths"

In transient conditions high currents and temperatures develop, forcing the electric motor and particularly the insulation materials to undergo severe multi-stress. Insulation degradation will progressively lead to short-circuits which are harmful for the traction motor, vehicle safety and reliability. This paper focuses on the thermal assessment of insulation's capacitance at switching frequencies. For this, thin-film winding insulation samples were thermally aged at different temperatures and for various periods of time. Dielectric spectroscopy was applied and the capacitance information at different frequencies was extracted. The measurements were substituted to statistical analysis under three factors namely; ageing time, temperature and frequency. It is also evaluated how appropriate it is to use capacitance measurements as a means for reliable prognostics. The statistical analysis depicts that the capacitance does not follow predictable ageing patterns, mainly because the material's dielectric properties are affected by a number of different degradation mechanisms that occur concurrently.","School of Mechanical, Aerospace and Automotive Engineering,School of Computing, Electronics and Maths"

For the pure systems our results support the early scaling predictions for the size dependence of the interfacial adsorption at both first- and second-order phase transitions. For the disordered systems, the interfacial adsorption at the (disordered induced) continuous transitions is discussed, applying standard scaling arguments and invoking findings for bulk critical properties. The self-averaging properties of the interfacial adsorption are also analyzed by studying the infinite limit-size extrapolation of properly defined signal-to-noise ratios.","School of Computing, Electronics and Maths"

It is a hybrid method, combining importance sampling through Markov chains with elements of sequential Monte Carlo in the form of population control. While it appears to provide algorithmic capabilities for the simulation of such systems that are roughly comparable to those of more established approaches such as parallel tempering, it is intrinsically much more suitable for massively parallel computing. Here, we tap into this structural advantage and present a highly optimized implementation of the population annealing algorithm on GPUs that promises speed-ups of several orders of magnitude as compared to a serial implementation on CPUs. While the sample code is for simulations of the 2D ferromagnetic Ising model, it should be easily adapted for simulations of other spin models, including disordered systems.

These systems should be able to support users with their context-aware information needs. This paper presents a new approach for enterprise IS&R systems using fuzzy logic to develop task, user and document profiles to model user information seeking behaviour. Relevance feedback was captured from real users engaged in IS&R tasks. The feedback was used to develop a linear regression model for predicting document relevancy based on implicit relevance indicators. Fuzzy relevance profiles were created using Term Frequency and Inverse Document Frequency (TF-IDF) analysis for the successful user queries. Fuzzy rule based summarisation was used to integrate the three profiles into a unified index reflecting the semantic weight of the query terms related to the task, user and document. The unified index was used to select the most relevant documents and experts related to the query topic. The overall performance of the system was evaluated based on standard precision and recall metrics which show significant improvements in retrieving relevant documents in response to user queries.","School of Computing, Electronics and Maths"

It is in fact an empirical construct for exploring open information, composed of three steps: document event detection, event network construction and event network analysis. First, documents are clustered into document events for reducing the impact of noisy and heterogeneous resources. Secondly, linguistic units (e.g., named entities or entity relations) are extracted from each document event and combined into an event network, which enables content-oriented retrieval. Then, in the final step, techniques such as social network or complex network can be applied to analyze the event network for exploring open information. In the implementation section, we provide examples of exploring open information via event network.","School of Computing, Electronics and Maths"

These boundary conditions, which we call duality-twisted boundary conditions, may be interpreted as inserting a specific defect line (""seam"") in the system, along noncontractible circles of the cylinder, before closing it into a torus. We derive exact expressions for the eigenvalues of a transfer matrix for the critical ferromagnetic Ising model on the M×N square lattice wrapped on the torus with a specific defect line. As a result we have obtained analytically the partition function for the Ising model with such boundary conditions. In the case of infinitely long cylinders of circumference L with duality-twisted boundary conditions we obtain the asymptotic expansion of the free energy and the inverse correlation lengths. We find that the ratio of subdominant finite-size correction terms in the asymptotic expansion of the free energy and the inverse correlation lengths should be universal. We verify such universal behavior in the framework of a perturbating conformal approach by calculating the universal structure constant Cn1n for descendent states generated by the operator product expansion of the primary fields. For such states the calculations of an universal structure constants is a difficult task, since it involves knowledge of the four-point correlation function, which in general is not fixed by conformal invariance except for some particular cases, including the Ising model.","School of Computing, Electronics and Maths"

PIN-FORMED plasma membrane proteins, involved in intercellular transport of the growth regulator, are key to the transmission of such auxin signals and subject to multilevel surveillance mechanisms, including reversible post-translational modifications. Apart from well-studied PIN protein modifications, namely phosphorylation and ubiquitylation, no further post-translational modifications have been described so far. Here, we focused on root-specific Arabidopsis PIN2 and explored functional implications of two evolutionary conserved cysteines, by a combination of in silico and molecular approaches. PIN2 sequence alignments and modeling predictions indicated that both cysteines are facing the cytoplasm and therefore would be accessible to redox status-controlled modifications. Notably, mutant pin2C−A alleles retained functionality, demonstrated by their ability to almost completely rescue defects of a pin2 null allele, whereas high resolution analysis of pin2C−A localization revealed increased intracellular accumulation, and altered protein distribution within plasma membrane micro-domains. The observed effects of cysteine replacements on root growth and PIN2 localization are consistent with a model in which redox status-dependent cysteine modifications participate in the regulation of PIN2 mobility, thereby fine-tuning polar auxin transport.","School of Computing, Electronics and Maths"

To overcome the unforbidden challenges in the advanced technologies like smart cities, 5G and Internet of Things (IoT), Cognitive Radio provides the solution to achieve high throughput and continuous connectivity for reliable communication.

We analyse its zeros in the complex-temperature plane in the case that h,=0. When Imh,=0 and r≥0, these zeros accumulate along a line that intersects the real temperature axis at the origin. This corresponds to the usual “phase transition” in a 1D system. However, for Imh,≠0 or r<0, the line of zeros intersects the positive part of the real temperature axis, which signals the existence of a phase transition at non-zero temperature.","School of Computing, Electronics and Maths"

The geographic coordinate systems could be used to produce new traveling salesman problem (TSP) instances with geographic information systems (GIS) features. The current paper introduces a recurrent framework designed for building a sequence of instances in a systematic way. The framework intends to model real-life random adverse events manifested on large areas, as massive rainfalls or the arrival of a polar front, or targeted relief supply in early stages of the response. As a proof of concept for this framework, we use the first Romanian TSP instance with the main human settlements, in order to derive several sequences of instances. Nowadays state-of-the-art algorithms for TSP are used to solve these instances. A branch-and-cut algorithm delivers the integer exact solutions, using substantial computing resources. An implementation of the Lin–Kernighan heuristic is used to rapidly find very good near-optimal integer solutions to the same instances. The Lin–Kernighan heuristic shows stability on the tested instances. Further work could be done to better exploit GIS features in order to efficiently tackle operations on large areas and to test the solutions delivered by other algorithms on new instances, derived using the introduced framework.,The final publication is available at Springer via http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10115-016-0938-8 ","School of Computing, Electronics and Maths"

The development of new two-dimensional materials, called meta-surfaces, have been used to control and tailor the electromagnetic waves propagation properties. Several studies focused their attention on phase modulation, very few on amplitude. However, there have been no general design procedure able to control both of them at the same time. Therefore, the aim of this paper is to develop a robust design tool to manipulate the electromagnetic wave behavior over flat and 3D objects. The proposed approach will be used to design, manufacture and experimentally measure metasurface-based devices for lenses, cloaking, manipulation and bending applications. Good agreement between analytical, numerical, and experimental results has been achieved, proving that the realized devices are wideband, polarization independent, easy to fabricate and can be scaled in different frequency ranges from microwave to optics.","School of Computing, Electronics and Maths"

Our model is as simple as possible but still captures the salient features of the instability which otherwise may be obscured by the technical details of more comprehensive numerical models and laboratory experiments. Firstly, we show the instability in liquid
metals, which are relatively poor conductors, differs significantly from the astrophysically relevant Tayler instability. In liquid metals, the instability develops on the magnetic response time scale, which depends on the conductivity and is much longer than the Alfvén time scale, on which the Tayler instability develops in well conducting fluids. Secondly, we show that this instability is an edge effect caused by the curvature of
the magnetic field, and its growth rate is determined by the linear current density and independent of the system size. Our results suggest that this instability may affect future liquid metal batteries when their size reaches a few meters.","School of Computing, Electronics and Maths"

This paper presents a study on the performance of an 85 W monocrystalline photovoltaic module under different conditions, with measurements being taken under indoor and outdoor conditions. To obtain maximum irradiation under outdoor conditions, the module was inclined at an angle of 25o facing the southern direction (UK). To investigate the I-V characteristic of the PV module a single diode electrical equivalent model has been developed using MATLAB-Simulink and the measured results are discussed together with the simulation results. The measured results have shown that the module is capable of generating 17.75 W/m2 with an efficiency of 7% and 138 W/m2 with an efficiency of 8% from indoor office building and outdoor conditions respectively in UK during summer time. This research work makes a significant contribution to photovoltaic researchers to identify the suitable applications such as embedded devices or body-worn sensor for use both in indoor and outdoor conditions.","School of Computing, Electronics and Maths"

A current paradigm is that the corresponding dissipation increases with the intensity of the magnetic field and as a result turbulent fluctuations are all the more damped as the magnetic field is strong. While this idea finds apparent support in the phenomenology of decaying turbulence, measurements of turbulence in duct flows and other, more complex configurations have produced seemingly contradicting results. The root of the controversy is that magnetic fields promote sufficient scale-dependent anisotropy to profoundly reorganize the structure of turbulence, so their net effect cannot be understood in terms of the additional dissipation only. Here we show that when turbulence is forced in a magnetic field that acts on turbulence itself rather than on the mechanisms that generate it, the field promotes large, nearly two-dimensional structures capturing sufficient energy to offset the loss due to Joule dissipation, with the net effect of increasing the intensity of turbulent fluctuations. This change of paradigm potentially carries important consequences for systems as diverse as the liquid cores of planets, accretion disks, and a wide range of metallurgical and nuclear engineering applications.","School of Computing, Electronics and Maths"

We show how user engagement with key ALT including personal pendant alarms, pull cords and intercoms is shaped and supported in important ways by the ongoing social interaction of residents and skilled staff at independent living schemes. We discuss implications of social leveraging for reconsidering the importance of human resource as part of independent living services, during a time of transition to new technological models, and in light of current funding and organizational priorities.","School of Computing, Electronics and Maths"

That work of Lenz and Ising marked the start of a scientific direction that, over nearly 100 years, delivered extraordinary successes in explaining collective behaviour in a vast variety of systems, both within and beyond the natural sciences. The broadness of the appeal of the Ising model is reflected in the variety of talks presented at the Ising lectures (http://www.icmp.lviv.ua/ising/) over the past two decades but requires that we restrict this report to a small selection of topics. The paper starts with some personal memoirs of Thomas Ising (Ernst’s son).

In a sufficiently strong magnetic field, the flow consists of two jets at the side walls walls and a near-stagnant core with the relative velocity ∼(cHa)−1. We find that for Ha≳300, the effect of wall conductivity on the stability of the flow is mainly determined by the effective Hartmann wall conductance ratio cHa. For c≪1, the increase of the magnetic field or that of the wall conductivity has a destabilizing effect on the flow. Maximal destabilization of the flow occurs at Ha≈30/c. In a stronger magnetic field with cHa≳30, the destabilizing effect vanishes and the asymptotic results of Priede et al. [J.

Hence, a hybrid artificial intelligence (AI) controller (HaiC) is designed to supervise the spindle speed cutting profile of machining processes to ensure the desired surface quality of the machined part is achieved. It is comprised of artificial neural networks (ANNs) and fuzzy logic (FL) predictive models, and a proportional-derivative (PD) loop, to promote an efficient control based on the manufacturing requirements. Milling experiments were carried out for data collection for the development of the predictive models. The control part is developed and implemented in a simulation environment, and its performance is assessed through several machining scenarios. The results show that the controller provides high-accuracy spindle speed control for assuring surface quality in milling operations. Furthermore, it can also be used for offline optimisation of the spindle speed at the process planning phase.","School of Computing, Electronics and Maths"

If we are to progress towards human and machine interaction that is engaging the human user, the machine should be able to recognize the emotional state of the user. Deep Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) have proven to be efficient in emotion recognition problems. The good degree of performance achieved by these classifiers can be attributed to their ability to self-learn a down-sampled feature vector that retains spatial information through filter kernels in convolutional layers. Given the view that random initialization of weights can lead to convergence to non-optimal local minima, in this paper we explore the impact of training the initial weights in an unsupervised manner. We study the effect of pre-training a Deep CNN as a Stacked Convolutional Auto-Encoder (SCAE) in a greedy layer-wise unsupervised fashion for emotion recognition using facial expression images. When trained with randomly initialized weights, our CNN emotion recognition model achieves a performance rate of 91.16% on the Karolinska Directed Emotional Faces (KDEF) dataset. In contrast, when each layer of the model, including the hidden layer, is pre-trained as an Auto-Encoder, the performance increases to 92.52%. Pre-training our CNN as a SCAE also reduces training time marginally.

Designing an efficient and fast route recovery mechanism scheme without incurring extra overheads or delays to repair the broken link is a desirable goal for any routing protocol. The route recovery algorithm in reactive routing protocols like AODV occurs only after a link failure is detected. However, we propose a new route discovery mechanism called Route Migration over Multiple link failure in Multi-Channel (RMMMC), which combines multiple paths and channels to provide a disjointed alternative route. When link failure is detected, the RMMMC reroutes the data packet through the alternative route in alternative channels that have been previously discovered. Furthermore, the RMMMC is resilient to multiple link failures. Unlike other route recovery approaches, nodes in RMMMC are considered to be equipped with a single transceiver. The RMMMC scheme is implemented and extensively evaluated by using an ns-2 simulator. Simulation results show that the proposed scheme achieves a better packet delivery ratio, throughput and reduces the routing overhead and end-to-end delay in a dense network.","School of Computing, Electronics and Maths"

This analysis predicts dimensional reduction,
i.e., that the critical properties of the random-field Ising model in D dimensions are identical to those of the pure Ising ferromagnet in D − 2 dimensions. It is well known that dimensional reduction is not true in three
dimensions, thus invalidating the perturbative renormalization group prediction. Here, we report high-precision numerical simulations of the 5D random-field Ising model at zero temperature. We illustrate universality by
comparing different probability distributions for the random fields.We compute all the relevant critical exponents
(including the critical slowing down exponent for the ground-state finding algorithm), as well as several other renormalization-group invariants. The estimated values of the critical exponents of the 5D random-field Ising model are statistically compatible to those of the pure 3D Ising ferromagnet. These results support the restoration of dimensional reduction at D = 5.We thus conclude that the failure of the perturbative renormalization group is a low-dimensional phenomenon.We close our contribution by comparing universal quantities for the random-field problem at dimensions 3 
2\leq D < 6 to their values in the pure Ising model at D − 2 dimensions, and we provide a clear verification of the Rushbrooke equality at all studied dimensions.","School of Computing, Electronics and Maths"

Detecting their positions in fluoroscopic X-ray images is important for several clinical applications, such as visibility enhancement for low dose X-ray images, and co-registration between 2D and 3D imaging modalities. As guiding catheters are made from thin plastic tubes, they can be deformed by cardiac and breathing motions. Therefore, detection is the essential step before automatic tracking of guiding catheters in live X-ray fluoroscopic images. However, there are several wire-like artifacts existing in X-ray images, which makes developing a real-time robust detection method very challenging. To solve those challenges in real-time, a localized machine learning algorithm is built to distinguish between guiding catheters and artifacts. As the machine learning algorithm is only applied to potential wire-like objects, which are obtained from vessel enhancement filters, the detection method is fast enough to be used in real-time applications. The other challenge is the low contrast between guiding catheters and background, as the majority of X-ray images are low dose. Therefore, the guiding catheter might be detected as a discontinuous curve object, such as a few disconnected line blocks from the vessel enhancement filter. A minimum energy method is developed to trace the whole wire object. Finally, the proposed methods are tested on 1102 images which are from 8 image sequences acquired from 3 clinical cases. Results show an accuracy of 0.87 ± 0.53 mm which is measured as the error distances between the detected object and the manually annotated object. The success rate of detection is 83.4%.","School of Computing, Electronics and Maths"

Through exploring the perceptions of coaches and players towards PA, its impact can be evaluated and areas for improvement highlighted (Bampouras et al., 2012; Wright et al., 2016). Previous research has explored coach and player perceptions of a range of PA provision from evaluation of ten 30-40 minutes feedback sessions (Groom & Cushion, 2005) to evaluation of PA support over a four year period (Bampouras et al., 2012). No study, however, has explored coach and player perception of PA provision within a Paralympic sport over any duration of service provision, let alone throughout a 4-year Paralympic cycle. The aim of this study, therefore, was to explore coach and player perceptions of the PA process within an elite men’s international wheelchair basketball programme over the four-year period leading up to and including the 2016 Rio Paralympic Games. Method Semi-structured interviews were conducted with three members of coaching staff and four players from a men’s international wheelchair basketball team. In the interview they were asked to reflect on the integration of a PA process during the four-year period and how the analyst supported the process. The interviews were transcribed verbatim and returned to participants for member-checking. Once participants confirmed the content, the transcripts were subjected to inductive thematic analysis and a triangulation process. Results Two overarching themes emerged from the narrative: (1) barriers to the use of PA to inform practice and (2) the establishment of the coach-analyst and player-analyst relationship. The first theme included aspects of availability, time, knowledge of the discipline, ability to utilise technology and conflict with a coach’s philosophy. The second theme resulted from emerging narratives surrounding communication, reputation and collective experiences. Discussion and Conclusion The person-implementation framework (Rizzuto & Reeves, 2007) was utilised to help explain the main barriers associated with using PA into problem sources, failure symptoms and leverage points. Sztompka's (1999) primary and secondary trustworthiness theory was then used to interpret how the development of a strong relationship between coaches, athletes and analysts could help remove any barriers. Coaches and players also believed future exposure and education to the possibilities of PA support was required. Through enhancing individuals’ knowledge and developing strong relationships, coaches and players could engage more actively within the PA process to inform practice.","School of Computing, Electronics and Maths"

The poems, which purported to have been composed by a third-century bard named Ossian, quickly achieved wide international acclaim. They invited comparisons with major works of the epic tradition, including Homer's Iliad and Odyssey, and effected a profound influence on the emergent Romantic period in literature and the arts. However, the work also provoked one of the most famous literary controversies of all time, colouring the reception of the poetry to this day. The authenticity of the poems was questioned by some scholars, while others protested that they misappropriated material from Irish mythological sources. Recent years have seen a growing critical interest in Ossian, initiated by revisionist and counter-revisionist scholarship and by the two-hundred-and-fiftieth anniversary of the first collected edition of the poems in 1765. Here we investigate Ossian from a networks-science point of view. We compare the connectivity structures underlying the societies described in the Ossianic narratives with those of ancient Greek and Irish sources. Despite attempts, from the outset, to position Ossian alongside the Homeric epics and to distance it from Irish sources, our results indicate significant network-structural differences between Macpherson's text and those of Homer. They also show a strong similarity between Ossianic networks and those of the narratives known as Acallam na Sen\'orach (Colloquy of the Ancients) from the Fenian Cycle of Irish mythology.,Publisher Statement: Electronic version of an article published as [Advances in Complex Systems, 19, 2016, 165008] [10.1142/S0219525916500089] © [copyright World Scientific Publishing Company] [http://www.worldscientific.com/worldscinet/acs]","School of Computing, Electronics and Maths"

Gardner",Ratiometric Decoding of Pheromones for a Biomimetic Infochemical Communication System,"Biosynthetic infochemical communication is an emerging scientific field employing molecular compounds for information transmission, labelling, and biochemical interfacing; having potential application in diverse areas ranging from pest management to group coordination of swarming robots. Our communication system comprises a chemoemitter module that encodes information by producing volatile pheromone components and a chemoreceiver module that decodes the transmitted ratiometric information via polymer-coated piezoelectric Surface Acoustic Wave Resonator (SAWR) sensors. The inspiration for such a system is based on the pheromone-based communication between insects. Ten features are extracted from the SAWR sensor response and analysed using multi-variate classification techniques, i.e., Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA), Probabilistic Neural Network (PNN), and Multilayer Perception Neural Network (MLPNN) methods, and an optimal feature subset is identified. A combination of steady state and transient features of the sensor signals showed superior performances with LDA and MLPNN. Although MLPNN gave excellent results reaching 100% recognition rate at 400 s, over all time stations PNN gave the best performance based on an expanded data-set with adjacent neighbours. In this case, 100% of the pheromone mixtures were successfully identified just 200 s after they were first injected into the wind tunnel. We believe that this approach can be used for future chemical communication employing simple mixtures of airborne molecules.","School of Computing, Electronics and Maths"

An extensive investigation on air-PCM-TES systems has been undertaken through passive and active methods and the advantages and disadvantages for each, are detailed. The thermal performances of these systems have been investigated through experimental and numerical approaches and listed in this paper. Passive methods e.g. use of PCMs in the building envelope present difficulty of exchanging a high rate of heat and therefore unsuitable for extreme climate. Therefore, active methods are adopted for extreme climates to meet the demand. Overall, when the right method is applied, air-PCM-TES systems have shown to be effectively providing free cooling and heating of the buildings through auxiliary sources.","School of Computing, Electronics and Maths,School of Energy, Construction and Environment"

Such problems sometimes elude the usual solving methods we are familiar with, forcing us to continuously improve these methods or to even completely reconsider the solving methodologies. When decision makers need faster and better results to more difficult problems, the quality of a decision support system is crucial. To estimate the quality of a decision support system when approaching difficult problems is not easy, but is very important when designing and conducting vital industrial processes or logistic operations. This paper studies the resilience of a solving method, initially designed for the static and deterministic TSP (Traveling Salesman Problem) variant, when applied to an uncertain and dynamic TSP version. This investigation shows how a supplementary level of complexity can be successfully handled. The traditional ant-based system under investigation is infused with a technique which allows the evaluation of its performances when uncertain input data are present. Like the real ant colonies do, the system rapidly adapts to repeated environmental changes. A comparison with the performance of another heuristic optimization method is also done.","School of Computing, Electronics and Maths"

Jackson",Applications of a finite-volume algorithm for incompressible MHD problems,"We present the theory, algorithms and implementation of a parallel finite-volume algorithm for the solution of the incompressible magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) equations using unstructured grids that are applicable for a wide variety of geometries. Our method implements a mixed Adams-Bashforth/Crank-Nicolson scheme for the nonlinear terms in the MHD equations and we prove that it is stable independent of the time step. To ensure that the solenoidal condition is met for the magnetic field, we use a method whereby a pseudo-pressure is introduced into the induction equation; since we are concerned with incompressible flows, the resulting Poisson equation for the pseudo-pressure is solved alongside the equivalent Poisson problem for the velocity field. We validate our code in a variety of geometries including periodic boxes, spheres, spherical shells, spheroids and ellipsoids; for the finite geometries we implement the so-called ferromagnetic or pseudo-vacuum boundary conditions appropriate for a surrounding medium with infinite magnetic permeability. This implies that the magnetic field must be purely perpendicular to the boundary. We present a number of comparisons against previous results and against analytical solutions, which verify the code's accuracy. This documents the code's reliability as a prelude to its use in more difficult problems. We finally present a new simple drifting solution for thermal convection in a spherical shell that successfully sustains a magnetic field of simple geometry. By dint of its rapid stabilization from the given initial conditions, we deem it suitable as a benchmark against which other self-consistent dynamo codes can be tested.","School of Computing, Electronics and Maths"

They first construct a n-dimensional copula density by stacking together n(n − 1)/2 bivariate copula density, and they then approximate arbitrarily well these bivariate copulas and the corresponding multivariate distribution using a semi-parametric method. One constructive approach involves the use of minimum information copulas that can be specified to any required degree of precision based on the available data (or possibly based on the experts’ judgments). By using this method, one is able to use a fixed finite dimensional family of copulas to be employed in terms of a vine construction, with the promise of a uniform level of approximation.,The basic idea behind this method is to use a two-dimensional ordinary polynomial series to approximate any log-density of a bivariate copula function by truncating the series at an appropriate point. We make this approximation method more accurate and computationally faster by using the orthonormal polynomial and Legendre multiwavelets (LMW) series as the basis functions. We show the derived approximations are more precise and computationally faster with better properties than the one proposed previous method in the literature. We then apply our method to modeling a dataset of Norwegian financial data that was previously analyzed in the series of articles, and finally compare our results by them. At the end, we present a method to simulate from the approximated models, and validate our approximation using the simulation results to recover the same dependency structure of the original data.","School of Computing, Electronics and Maths"

In this paper, we have proposed an integrated approach for biometric-based image retrieval and processing which addresses the two issues. The first issue is related to the poor visibility of the images produced by the embedded and distributed surveillance cameras, and the second issue is concerned with the effective image retrieval based on the user query. This paper addresses the first issue by proposing an integrated image enhancement approach based on contrast enhancement and colour balancing methods. The contrast enhancement method is used to improve the contrast, while the colour balancing method helps to achieve a balanced colour. Importantly, in the colour balancing method, a new process for colour cast adjustment is introduced which relies on statistical calculation. It adjusts the colour cast and maintains the luminance of the image. The integrated image enhancement approach is applied to the enhancement of low quality images produced by surveillance cameras. The paper addresses the second issue relating to image retrieval by proposing a content-based image retrieval approach. The approach is based on the three features extraction methods namely colour, texture and shape. Colour histogram is used to extract the colour features of an image. Gabor filter is used to extract the texture features and the moment invariant is used to extract the shape features of an image. The use of these three algorithms ensures that the proposed image retrieval approach produces results which are highly relevant to the content of an image query, by taking into account the three distinct features of the image and the similarity metrics based on Euclidean measure. In order to retrieve the most relevant images, the proposed approach also employs a set of fuzzy heuristics to improve the quality of the results further. The results show the proposed approaches perform better than the well-known existing approaches.","School of Computing, Electronics and Maths"

This growing interest is motivated by its pedagogical effectiveness and the fact that, in labour contexts, enterprises organize their employees in teams to carry out complex projects. Despite its crucial importance in the classroom and industry, there is a lack of support for the team formation process. Not only do many factors influence team performance, but the problem becomes exponentially costly if teams are to be optimized. In this article, we propose a tool whose aim it is to cover such a gap. It combines artificial intelligence techniques such as coalition structure generation, Bayesian learning, and Belbin’s role theory to facilitate the generation of working groups in an educational context. This tool improves current state of the art proposals in three ways: i) it takes into account the feedback of other teammates in order to establish the most predominant role of a student instead of self-perception questionnaires; ii) it handles uncertainty with regard to each student’s predominant team role; iii) it is iterative since it considers information from several interactions in order to improve the estimation of role assignments. We tested the performance of the proposed tool in an experiment involving students that took part in three different team activities. The experiments suggest that the proposed tool is able to improve different teamwork aspects such as team dynamics and student satisfaction.","School of Computing, Electronics and Maths"

Zhou",An Evidential Fusion Approach for Gender Profiling,"CCTV (Closed-Circuit TeleVision) systems are broadly deployed in the present world. To ensure in-time reaction for intelligent surveillance, it is a fundamental task for real-world applications to determine the gender of people of interest. However, normal video algorithms for gender profiling (usually face profiling) have three drawbacks. First, the profiling result is always uncertain. Second, the profiling result is not stable. The degree of certainty usually varies over time, sometimes even to the extent that a male is classified as a female, and vice versa. Third, for a robust profiling result in cases that a person’s face is not visible, other features, such as body shape, are required. These algorithms may provide different recognition results - at the very least, they will provide different degrees of certainties. To overcome these problems, in this paper, we introduce an Dempster-Shafer (DS) evidential approach that makes use of profiling results from multiple algorithms over a period of time, in particular, Denoeux’s cautious rule is applied for fusing mass functions through time lines. Experiments show that this approach does provide better results than single profiling results and classic fusion results. Furthermore, it is found that if severe mis-classification has occurred at the beginning of the time line, the combination can yield undesirable results. To remedy this weakness, we further propose three extensions to the evidential approach proposed above incorporating notions of time-window, time-attenuation, and time-discounting, respectively. These extensions also applies Denoeux’s rule along with time lines and take the DS approach as a special case. Experiments show that these three extensions do provide better results than their predecessor when mis-classifications occur.,Publisher statement: NOTICE: this is the author’s version of a work that was accepted for publication in Information Sciences.

The Motivation Theory and Theory of Planned Behavior besides Triandis model were applied as the theoretical backbone of the conceptual framework. The results of the data analysis showed that earning a reputation, and gaining promotion as an extrinsic motivation and curiosity satisfaction as an intrinsic motivation have positive effects on employees' attitude toward ISKS. However, self-worth satisfaction does not influence ISKS attitude. In addition, the findings revealed that attitude, perceived behavioral control, and subjective norms have positive effects on ISKS intention and ISKS intention affects ISKS behavior. The outcomes also showed that organizational support influences ISKS behavior more than trust.

The proposed multi-layer Internet of things database schema includes logical nodes, geography nodes, storage nodes, and application nodes. These data nodes cooperate with each other to facilitate the data storing, indexing, and querying. Second, a searching algorithm is designed based on pruning strategy. The complexity of the algorithm is also analyzed. Finally, the multi-layer Internet of things database schema and its application are illustrated in a smart city construction project in Shanghai, China, recommending available charging points to the customers who need to charge their electric energy–driven cars.

The interest in conflict resolution lies in diverse reasons. One of the main reasons is that computational systems have gradually shifted towards a distributed paradigm where heterogeneous entities should include computational conflict resolution mechanisms, such as proposed by agreement technologies. This chapter gives an overview of these technologies, which are needed in order to ensure the accomplishment of the global system goal and to solve conflicts. Among agreement technologies, automated negotiation is proposed as one key mechanism in conflict resolution due to its analogous use in human conflict resolution. Automated negotiation consists of an automated exchange of proposals carried out by software agents on behalf of their users. Another key technology is argumentation, which provides a fruitful means of dealing with conflicts and knowledge inconsistencies. Agents can reach agreements by engaging in argumentation dialogues with their opponents in a discussion.","School of Computing, Electronics and Maths"

While highly-dense wireless networks provide efficient and sustainable solutions to collect precise environmental information, a new channel access scheme is needed to solve the channel collision problem caused by the large number of competing nodes accessing the channel simultaneously. In this paper, we propose a space-time random access method based on a directional data transmission strategy, by which collisions in the wireless channel are significantly decreased and channel utility efficiency is greatly enhanced. Simulation results show that our proposed method can decrease the packet loss rate to less than 2% in large scale WSNs and in comparison with other channel access schemes for WSNs, the average network throughput can be doubled.

It also discusses the potential health implications pertaining to exceeding levels of pollutants where these are applicable. In order to attain informed decisions on the protection of the health of populations from elevated levels of air pollution, an understanding of spatial-temporal variance of air pollutant patterns is necessary. The study highlights the fact that Bangalore and other similar developing cities do not have an adequate number of fixed monitoring stations that could provide a complete coverage of the air pollution levels for the entire city. It is suggested that this can be overcome by using geospatial interpolation techniques that provide a complete coverage of the levels of pollutants, as well as assist in mapping health characteristics of the population, in order to reach evidence-based decisions and target effective interventions.","School of Strategy and Leadership,School of Energy, Construction and Environment,School of Computing, Electronics and Maths"

Ijimah, Kuo-Ming Chao",Adaptive fusion of color and spatial features for noise-robust retrieval of colored logo and trademark images,"Due to their uniqueness and high value commercially, logos/trademarks play a key role in e-business based global marketing. However, existing trademark/logo retrieval techniques and content-based image retrieval methods are mostly designed for generic images, which cannot provide effective retrieval of trademarks/logos. Although color and spatial features have been intensively investigated for logo image retrieval, in most cases they were applied separately. When these are combined in a fused manner, a fixed weighting is normally used between them which cannot reflect the significance of these features in the images. When the image quality is degraded by various reasons such as noise, the reliability of color and spatial features may change in different ways, such that the weights between them should be adapted to such changes. In this paper, adaptive fusion of color and spatial descriptors is proposed for colored logo/trademark image retrieval. First, color quantization and k-means are combined for effective dominant color extraction. For each extracted dominant color, a component-based spatial descriptor is derived for local features. By analyzing the image histogram, an adaptive fusion of these two features is achieved for more effective logo abstraction and more accurate image retrieval. The proposed approach has been tested on a database containing over 2300 logo/trademark images. Experimental results have shown that the proposed methodology yields improved retrieval precision and outperforms three state-of-the-art techniques even with added Gaussian, salt and pepper, and speckle noise.","School of Computing, Electronics and Maths"

A fuzzy multi-criteria approach is developed to determine interdependencies between nodes in a GPN using experts’ knowledge. An efficient and accurate method based on fuzzy interval calculus in the Fuzzy DIIM is proposed. The risk evaluation method takes into account various risk scenarios relevant to the GPN and likelihoods of their occurrences. A case of beverage production from food industry is used to showcase the application of the proposed risk evaluation method. It is demonstrated how it can be used for GPN strategic decision making.

It determines, often to a large extent, the amount of research funding flowing into universities and similar institutes from governmental agencies and it impacts upon academic careers. Policy makers are becoming increasingly reliant upon, and influenced by, the outcomes of such evaluations. In response, university managers are increasingly attracted to simple metrics as guides to the dynamics of the positions of their various institutions in league tables. However, these league tables are invariably drawn up by inexpert bodies such as newspapers and magazines, using arbitrary measures and criteria. Terms such as ""critical mass"" and ""h-index"" are bandied about without understanding of what they actually mean. Rather than accepting the rise and fall of universities, departments and individuals on a turbulent sea of arbitrary measures, we suggest it is incumbent upon the scientific community itself to clarify their nature. Here we report on recent attempts to do that by properly defining critical mass and showing how group size influences research quality. We also examine currently predominant metrics and show that these fail as reliable indicators of group research quality.

This approach is a combination of the well known Arousal Valence model of emotion and the newly introduced Affective Trajectories Hypothesis. An adaptive data driven fuzzy method is proposed in order to extract personalized emotion models, and successfully visualise the associations of these models’ basic elements, to different emotional labels, using easily interpretable fuzzy rules. Namely we explore how the combinations of arousal, valence, prediction of the future, and the experienced outcome after this prediction, enable us to differentiate between different emotional labels. We use the results obtained from a user study consisting of an online survey, to demonstrate the potential applicability of this affective modelling approach, and test the effectiveness and stability of its adaptive element, which accounts for individual differences between the users. We also propose a basic architecture in order for this approach to be used effectively by AC systems, and finally we present an implementation of a personalised learning system which utilises the suggested framework. This implementation is tested through a pilot experimental session consisting of a tutorial on fuzzy logic which was conducted under an activity-led and problem based learning context.","School of Computing, Electronics and Maths"

We prove several exact relations for general graphs that allow us to derive unambiguously the finite-size scaling behavior of the density of bridges and non-bridges. For percolation, we are also able to characterize the point for which clusters become maximally fragile and show that it is connected to the concept of the bridge load. Combining our exact treatment with further results from conformal field theory, we uncover a surprising behavior of the (normalized) variance of the number of (non-)bridges, showing that it diverges in two dimensions below the value View the MathML source of the cluster coupling q. Finally, we show that a partial or complete pruning of bridges from clusters enables estimates of the backbone fractal dimension that are much less encumbered by finite-size corrections than more conventional approaches.

We derive an asymptotic solution for the base flow that is valid for not only high but also moderate magnetic fields. This solution shows that, for low wall conductance ratios c≪1, an extremely strong magnetic field with Hartmann number Ha∼c−4 is required to attain the asymptotic flow regime considered in previous studies. We use a vector streamfunction–vorticity formulation and a Chebyshev collocation method to solve the eigenvalue problem for three-dimensional small-amplitude perturbations in ducts with realistic wall conductance ratios c=1, 0.1 and 0.01 and Hartmann numbers up to 104. As for similar flows, instability in a sufficiently strong magnetic field is found to occur in the sidewall jets with characteristic thickness δ∼Ha−1/2. This results in the critical Reynolds number and wavenumber increasing asymptotically with the magnetic field as Rec∼110Ha1/2 and kc∼0.5Ha1/2. The respective critical Reynolds number based on the total volume flux in a square duct with c≪1 is Re¯¯¯¯c≈520. Although this value is somewhat larger than Re¯¯¯¯c≈313 found by Ting et al. (Intl J. Engng Sci., vol. 29 (8), 1991, pp. 939–948) for the asymptotic sidewall jet profile, it still appears significantly lower than the Reynolds numbers at which turbulence is observed in experiments as well as in direct numerical simulations of this type of flow.","School of Computing, Electronics and Maths"

Participants randomized to group 2 received treatment as usual for the first 10weeks and crossed over to the serious game intervention in addition to treatment as usual forthe subsequent 10 weeks. Primary (parent report) and secondary (parent, teacher, and childself-report) outcome measures were administered at baseline, 10 weeks, and 10-week followup.Results: After 10 weeks, participants in group 1 group compared to group 2 achievedsignificantly greater improvements on the primary outcome of time management skills (parentreported; P=.004) and on secondary outcomes of time management (teacher reported; P=.09),the social skill of responsibility (parent reported; P=.04), and working memory (parent reported;P=.02).

The flow takes place in a transverse, horizontal magnetic field. The results show that up to four different local minima may be present in the neural stability curve. Up to two of these modes may be the most unstable depending, critically, on the value of the Hartmann number. Over a wide range of moderate to high Hartmann numbers thermal waves dominate the instability. As the Hartmann number increases, however, this mode is strongly damped. Then the so-called Hartmann mode takes over, which involves the characteristic Hartmann layers at the walls appearing due to modification of the basic velocity profile by the magnetic field. Overall, for liquid metals at high magnetic fields the basic flow is very stable. Variation of the Prandtl number in a wide range has also been performed as, depending on the type of an electrically conducting fluid (liquid metal or various kind of electrolytes), the Prandtl number varies over several orders of magnitude. As may be expected, the increase of the Prandtl number lowers the instability threshold for the thermal waves.

The fluid flows owing to the horizontal temperature gradient in the presence of a vertical magnetic field. The main interest here is in the stability of the flow for a sufficiently strong magnetic field, for the Hartmann number Ha > 10, and increasing to high values, of the order of 103–104. The Prandtl number, Pr, has been fixed at Pr = 0.015. It is shown that besides the Hartmann number the instability strongly depends on the type of the thermal boundary conditions at the horizontal walls. For thermally conducting walls the basic temperature profile exhibits zones of unstable thermal stratification, which leads to instabilities owing to the Rayleigh-Bénard mechanism. However, the transitions between various, most unstable modes as Ha increases are not trivial. For sufficiently high values of Ha, the most unstable mode consists of transverse oscillatory rolls located in the region of unstable stratification. For thermally insulating walls, the transitions are simpler, and for sufficiently high Ha, the most unstable mode consists of longitudinal, steady, three-dimensional mode which is concentrated in the Hartmann layers at the horizontal boundaries. This mode has a combined dynamic-thermal origin and is owed to a strong shear in the Hartmann layers. The electrical boundary conditions do not qualitatively affect the picture of transitions between modes for both thermally conducting and thermally insulating walls.,Publisher Statement: ,

Makris",Hierarchical transfer learning for online recognition of compound actions,"Recognising human actions in real-time can provide users with a natural user interface (NUI) enabling a range of innovative and immersive applications. A NUI application should not restrict users’ movements; it should allow users to transition between actions in quick succession, which we term as compound actions. However, the majority of action recognition researchers have focused on individual actions, so their approaches are limited to recognising single actions or multiple actions that are temporally separated.

This paper proposes a novel online action recognition method for fast detection of compound actions. A key contribution is our hierarchical body model that can be automatically configured to detect actions based on the low level body parts that are the most discriminative for a particular action. Another key contribution is a transfer learning strategy to allow the tasks of action segmentation and whole body modelling to be performed on a related but simpler dataset, combined with automatic hierarchical body model adaption on a more complex target dataset.

Experimental results on a challenging and realistic dataset show an improvement in action recognition performance of 16% due to the introduction of our hierarchical transfer learning. The proposed algorithm is fast with an average latency of just 2 frames (66 ms) and outperforms state of the art action recognition algorithms that are capable of fast online action recognition.

It combines the power of simulated annealing, Boltzmann weighted differential reproduction and sequential Monte Carlo process to bring the population of replicas to the equilibrium even in the low-temperature region. Moreover, it provides a very good estimate of the free energy. The fact that population annealing algorithm is performed over a large number of replicas with many spin updates, makes it a good candidate for massive parallelism. We chose the GPU programming using a CUDA implementation to create a highly optimized simulation. It has been previously shown for the frustrated Ising antiferromagnet on the stacked triangular lattice with a ferromagnetic interlayer coupling, that standard Markov Chain Monte Carlo simulations fail to equilibrate at low temperatures due to the effect of kinetic freezing of the ferromagnetically ordered chains. We applied the population annealing to study the case with the isotropic intra- and interlayer antiferromagnetic coupling (J2/|J1| = −1). The reached ground states correspond to non-magnetic degenerate states, where chains are antiferromagnetically ordered, but there is no long-range ordering between them, which is analogical with Wannier phase of the 2D triangular Ising antiferromagnet.

Tian, K.H. Wiltshire, D. Xiao, Z Zhu",Global impacts of the 1980s regime shift,"Despite evidence from a number of Earth systems that abrupt temporal changes known as regime shifts are important, their nature, scale and mechanisms remain poorly documented and understood. Applying principal component analysis, change-point analysis and a sequential t-test analysis of regime shifts to 72 time series, we confirm that the 1980s regime shift represented a major change in the Earth's biophysical systems from the upper atmosphere to the depths of the ocean and from the Arctic to the Antarctic, and occurred at slightly different times around the world. Using historical climate model simulations from the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project Phase 5 (CMIP5) and statistical modelling of historical temperatures, we then demonstrate that this event was triggered by rapid global warming from anthropogenic plus natural forcing, the latter associated with the recovery from the El Chichón volcanic eruption. The shift in temperature that occurred at this time is hypothesized as the main forcing for a cascade of abrupt environmental changes. Within the context of the last century or more, the 1980s event was unique in terms of its global scope and scale; our observed consequences imply that if unavoidable natural events such as major volcanic eruptions interact with anthropogenic warming unforeseen multiplier effects may occur.

With recent high-profile attacks it has become clear that training in cyber security is needed.

Thus cyber security seems especially well-suited to Serious Games.

This paper investigates whether games can be effective cyber security training tools. The study is conducted by means of a structured literature review supplemented with a general web search.

While there are early positive indications there is not yet enough evidence to draw any definite conclusions. There is a clear gap in target audience with almost all products and studies targeting the general public and very little attention given to IT professionals and managers. The products and studies also mostly work over a short period, while it is known that short-term interventions are not particularly effective at affecting behavioural change.

Decision trees were exploited to classify each of the users’ data. In parallel for comparison, Support Vector Machines (SVMs) were also used for classification in association with an Ant Colony Optimization (ACO) feature selection technique. The results obtained from this study are encouraging as low False Accept Rates (FAR) and False Reject Rates (FRR) were achieved in the experimentation phase.

Menzel",Forecasting bark beetle early flight activity with plant phenology,"Bark beetle outbreaks are a major threat to forest productivity, and a robust forecast of early flight activity is necessary for inhibition or mitigation of large-scale infestations. We used spring phenology of common wild plants in a phenology-based forecasting approach for European spruce bark beetle Ips typographicus L. early flight activity in Bavaria, Southern Germany, and tested this novel approach against traditional thermal sum-based predictions. Our phenology-based forecast employing the 2 phenological phases of first flowering of common snowdrop Galanthus nivalis L. and leaf budburst of horse chestnut Aesculus hippocastanum L. proved to be more robust and accurate than the thermal sum-based forecast. This is explained by both bark beetle phenology and plant phenology being results of a complex control chain of environmental factors, which can be approximated by temperature sums only to a limited degree. However, our space-for-time approach demonstrates strong and unequivocal temperature sensitivity of bark beetle and plant phenology. This indicates a common pattern in bioclimatic mediation of ecophysiological processes for both plants and insects as the mechanistic foundation for forecasting. In the case of costly bark beetle activity monitoring data often characterised by gaps and irregular sampling intervals, plant phenology can thus provide an easily observable alternative or complementary predictor for early flight activity. Our results indicate that forest practitioners can benefit from simple phenological observations to improve the timing of adequate management measures to mitigate bark beetle mass infestations.

The influences of the air inlet temperatures and velocities have been investigated on the charging/discharging time of the PCM panels, heating/cooling load and effectiveness over the phase transition. These parameters play a vital on determining thermal performance of an air-PCM unit. Air inlet temperatures of 34 °C, 36 °C and 38 °C and air inlet velocities of 0.6 m/s, 1.6 m/s and 2.5 m/s. have been studied. The increase of the air inlet velocity reduced the charging and discharging time, however not linearly. The time for the complete melting and solidification is substantially reduced when the velocity has been increased from 0.6 m/s to 1.6 m/s. The air inlet temperature has been proved to be most important factor affecting the discharging time. For lower air inlet velocity the cooling and heating loads achieve lower values but remain nearly constant over a longer period of time. The effectiveness reaches its highest values for the air inlet velocity of 0.6 m/s for the charging and discharging processes. It has been concluded that discharging time can be extended by reducing the air inlet velocity and making the technology more suitable for heating and cooling applications for the buildings. A simplified methodology is proposed for the analysis of the PCM charging and discharging process through the identification of the critical points as result of the heat transfer behaviour in the air- PCM unit.","School of Computing, Electronics and Maths,School of Energy, Construction and Environment"

Their effectiveness can further be increased for building heating/cooling applications if used along with energy storage. However, achieving good heat transfer between energy storage material and air is still a challenge.

However, no study provides comprehensive analysis on their complex and non-stationary heat transfer characteristics. This paper focuses on the influences of thermal conductivity enhancers (TCEs) on heat transfer performance inside the phase change material (PCM) during the melting and solidification processes for solar chimney application. Four types of TCEs namely vertical fin (VF), horizontal fin (HF), honeycomb structure (HCS) and square cell structure (SCS) have been used in the study. The experimental results show that the VF, HF, HCS and SCS reduces the melting time by 8%, 12%, 14.5% and 16%, respectively compared to the pure PCM sample. It is also being found that the VF and HF with the same volume fraction have different effects on the heat transfer inside the PCM during the melting process proving that the geometry and distribution of fins are very important for the heat transfer enhancement.","School of Computing, Electronics and Maths,School of Energy, Construction and Environment"

Ansine",Differences between urban and rural hedges in England revealed by a citizen science project,"Background: Hedges are both ecologically and culturally important and are a distinctive feature of the British landscape.
However the overall length of hedges across Great Britain is decreasing. Current challenges in studying hedges
relate to the dominance of research on rural, as opposed to urban, hedges, and their variability and geographical
breadth. To help address these challenges and to educate the public on the importance of hedge habitats for wildlife,
in 2010 the Open Air Laboratories (OPAL) programme coordinated a hedge-focused citizen science survey.
Results: Results from 2891 surveys were analysed. Woody plant species differed significantly between urban and
rural areas. Beech, Holly, Ivy, Laurel, Privet and Yew were more commonly recorded in urban hedges whereas Blackthorn,
Bramble, Dog Rose, Elder and Hawthorn were recorded more often in rural hedges. Urban and rural differences
were shown for some groups of invertebrates. Ants, earwigs and shieldbugs were recorded more frequently in urban
hedges whereas blowflies, caterpillars, harvestmen, other beetles, spiders and weevils were recorded more frequently
in rural hedges. Spiders were the most frequently recorded invertebrate across all surveys. The presence of hard
surfaces adjacent to the hedge was influential on hedge structure, number and diversity of plant species, amount of
food available for wildlife and invertebrate number and diversity. In urban hedges with one adjacent hard surface,
the food available for wildlife was significantly reduced and in rural hedges, one adjacent hard surface affected the
diversity of invertebrates.
Conclusions: This research highlights that urban hedges may be important habitats for wildlife and that hard surfaces
may have an impact on both the number and diversity of plant species and the number and diversity of invertebrates.
This study demonstrates that citizen science programmes that focus on hedge surveillance can work and have
the added benefit of educating the public on the importance of hedgerow habitats.

In the present contribution we provide a detailed description of this combined scheme, explaining in detail the zero-temperature numerical scheme and developing the generalized fluctuation-dissipation formula that allowed us to compute connected and disconnected correlation functions of the model. We discuss the error evolution of our method and we illustrate the infinite limit-size extrapolation of several observables within phenomenological renormalization. We present an extension of the quotients method that allows us to obtain estimates of the critical exponent α of the specific heat of the model via the scaling of the bond energy and we discuss the self-averaging properties of the system and the algorithmic aspects of the maximum-flow algorithm used.","School of Computing, Electronics and Maths"

We examine experiences of tuning the energy profile for two near-production wireless sensor systems and demonstrate the need for (a) microbenchmark-based energy consumption profiling, (b) examining start-up costs, and (c) monitoring the nodes during long-term deployments. The tuning exercise resulted in reductions in energy consumption of a) 93% for a multihop Telos-based system (average power 0.029 mW) b) 94.7% for a single hop Ti- 8051-based system during startup, and c) 39% for a Ti- 8051 system post start-up.

This novel result is at odds with previous studies, which use the electromagnetic work in the local electron fluid frame, i.e., J⋅(E+ve×B), as a proxy for turbulent dissipation to argue that heating follows the intermittent spatial structure of the electric current.

The self-reflective process occurs offline between episodes to help the agent to learn to navigate towards a goal location and boost its online performance. In particular, a so far optimal experience is recalled and compared with other similar but suboptimal episodes to reemphasize worthy decisions and deemphasize unworthy ones using eligibility and learning traces. At the same time, relatively bad experience is forgotten to remove its confusing effect. We set up a layer-wise deep actor-critic architecture and apply the self-reflection process to help to train it. We show that the self-reflective model seems to work well and initial experimental result on real robot shows that the agent accomplished good success rate in reaching a goal location.

Not surprisingly, cells encode diverse regulatory mechanisms to buffer noise. One such mechanism is the incoherent feedforward circuit. We analyze a simplistic version of this circuit, where an upstream regulator X affects both the production and degradation of a protein Y. Thus, any random increase in X's copy numbers would increase both production and degradation, keeping Y levels unchanged. To study its stochastic dynamics, we formulate this network into a mathematical model using the Chemical Master Equation formulation. We prove that if the functional dependence of Y's production and degradation on X is similar, then the steady-distribution of Y's copy numbers is independent of X. To investigate how fluctuations in Y propagate downstream, a protein Z whose production rate only depend on Y is introduced. Intriguingly, results show that the extent of noise in Z increases with noise in X, in spite of the fact that the magnitude of noise in Y is invariant of X. Such counter intuitive results arise because X enhances the time-scale of fluctuations in Y, which amplifies fluctuations in downstream processes. In summary, while feedforward systems can buffer a protein from noise in its upstream regulators, noise can propagate downstream due to changes in the time-scale of fluctuations.","School of Computing, Electronics and Maths"

We present 3 new alternative methods for performing dropout on a deep neural network which improves the effectiveness of the dropout method over the same training period. These methods select neurons to be dropped through statistical values calculated using a neurons change in weight, the average size of a neuron’s weights, and the output variance of a neuron. We found that increasing the probability of dropping neurons with smaller values of these statistics and decreasing the probability of those with larger statistics gave an improved result in training over 10,000 epochs. The most effective of these was found to be the Output Variance method, giving an average improvement of 1.17 % accuracy over traditional dropout methods.","School of Computing, Electronics and Maths"

However, understanding the impacts of spatial variability in ET and the appropriate scale at which ET data should be incorporated into hydrological models, particularly at the regional scale, is often overlooked. This is in contrast to dealing with the spatial variability in rainfall data where existing guidance is widely available. This paper assesses the impacts of scale on the estimation of reference ET (ETo) by comparing data from individual weather stations against values derived from three national datasets, at varying resolutions. These include the UK Climate Impacts Programme 50 km climatology (UKCP50), the UK Met Office 5 km climatology (UKMO5) and the regional values published in the Agricultural Climate of England and Wales (ACEW). The national datasets were compared against the individual weather station data and the UKMO5 was shown to provide the best estimate of ETo at a given site. The potential impacts on catchment modelling were then considered by mapping variance in ETo to show how geographical location and catchment size can have a major impact, with small lowland catchments having much higher variance than those with much larger areas or in the uplands. Some important implications for catchment hydrological modelling are highlighted.","School of Computing, Electronics and Maths"

Large robots such as da-Vinci are being used in this purpose, whereas research of miniature robots for laparoscopic and endoscopic use, is growing in the recent years. A comprehensive literature search is performed using keywords’ laparoscopic robot, capsule endoscope, surgical medical robot etc. primarily for the time period of 2000–2015. The articles relevant to the theme of the paper are reviewed and included in the paper. This paper concentrates medical robots for minimally invasive diagnosis and intervention in general and propulsions of miniature robots in particular. Robots are classified and compared using critical characteristics and summarized in Tables 1–6. Large robots such as da-Vinci are successfully used in many procedures e.g. neurosurgery, cardiothoracic surgery etc. However there are needs for more functionality which might lead to flexible robots. For miniature robots, each propulsion mechanism has some advantages and disadvantages. While external magnetic propulsions have potential to provide propulsion without increasing the robot size, they lack precise position control and may require expensive and bulky equipment. On the other hand internal propulsions have the capability of precise position control but require mechanisms which need substantial amount of power to drive. Hybrid propulsion which combines best features of both internal and external propulsions could be a solution for this. Robots have improved the healthcare services for many medical procedures. However, still there are challenges to address to enable use of medical robots universally inside and outside hospitals for diagnosis and interventions.","School of Computing, Electronics and Maths"

AODV is a reactive MANET routing protocol that is vulnerable to a dramatic collapse of network performance in the presence of blackhole attack. The paper introduces a new concept of Self-Protocol Trustiness (SPT) in which detecting a malicious intruder is accomplished by complying with the normal protocol behavior and lures the malicious node to give an implicit avowal of its malicious behavior. We present a Blackhole Resisting Mechanism (BRM) to resist such attacks that can be incorporated into any reactive routing protocol. It does not require expensive cryptography or authentication mechanisms, but relies on locally applied timers and thresholds to classify nodes as malicious. No modifications to the packet formats are needed, so the overhead is a small amount of calculation at nodes, and no extra communication. Using NS2 simulation, we compare the performance of networks using AODV under blackhole attacks with and without our mechanism to SAODV, showing that it significantly reduces the effect of a blackhole attack.","School of Computing, Electronics and Maths"

As such, there should be no remaining doubt regarding its validity. However, finite-size scaling, which derives from it, has long been poorly understood above the upper critical dimension dc in models with free boundary conditions. In addition to its fundamental significance for scaling theories, the issue is important at a practical level because finite-size, statistical-physics systems with free boundaries and above dc are experimentally relevant for long-range interactions. Here, we address the roles played by Fourier modes for such systems and show that the current phenomenological picture is not supported for all thermodynamic observables with either free or periodic boundaries. In particular, the expectation that dangerous irrelevant variables cause Gaussian-fixed-point scaling indices to be replaced by Landau mean-field exponents for all Fourier modes is incorrect. Instead, the Gaussian-fixed-point exponents have a direct physical manifestation for some modes above the upper critical dimension.","School of Computing, Electronics and Maths"

Recent experimental developments aimed at interrogating anew the low-temperature properties of these systems, in particular whether the predicted transition to long-range order occurs, behoove researchers to scrutinize our current dipolar spin ice model description of these materials. In this work, we do so by combining extensive Monte Carlo simulations and mean-field theory calculations to analyze data from previous magnetization, diffuse neutron scattering, and specific-heat measurements on the paradigmatic Dy2Ti2O7 spin ice material. In this work, we also reconsider the possible importance of the nuclear specific heat Cnuc in Dy2Ti2O7. We find that Cnuc is not entirely negligible below a temperature ∼0.5 K and must therefore be taken into account in a quantitative analysis of the calorimetric data of this compound below that temperature. We find that in this material, small effective spin-spin exchange interactions compete with the magnetostatic dipolar interaction responsible for the main spin ice phenomenology. This causes an unexpected “refrustration” of the long-range order that would be expected from the incompletely self-screened dipolar interaction and which positions the material at the boundary between two competing classical long-range-ordered ground states. This allows for the manifestation of new physical low-temperature phenomena in Dy2Ti2O7, as exposed by recent specific-heat measurements. We show that among the four most likely causes for the observed upturn of the specific heat at low temperature [an exchange-induced transition to long-range order, quantum non-Ising (transverse) terms in the effective spin Hamiltonian, the nuclear hyperfine contribution, and random disorder], only the last appears to be reasonably able to explain the calorimetric data.","School of Computing, Electronics and Maths"

The dominant weather pattern is monsoon from June to November, followed by hot and dry winter months when rainfall is scarce. Physical and chemical soil characteristics in each of the stations were analysed on five separate occasions, the first before the onset of monsoon, three during and the last post-monsoon. The plant community pattern was confirmed by quadrat survey. A pH gradient decreased with distance from the shoreline. Nutrient concentrations were deficient, increasing only in small amounts until the furthest station inland. At that location, there was a distinct and abrupt pedological transition zone from psammite to humic soils. There was a significant increase over previous stations in mean organic matter, ammonium nitrate and soil-water retention, although the increase in real terms was small. ANOVA showed significant variation in electrical conductivity, phosphorus, calcium, magnesium and sodium concentrations over time.

The direction, magnitude and timing of climate sensitivity varied markedly among organisms within taxonomic and trophic groups. Despite this variability, we detected systematic variation in the direction and magnitude of phenological climate sensitivity. Secondary consumers showed consistently lower climate sensitivity than other groups. We used mid-century climate change projections to estimate that the timing of phenological events could change more for primary consumers than for species in other trophic levels (6.2 versus 2.5–2.9 days earlier on average), with substantial taxonomic variation (1.1–14.8 days earlier on average).","School of Computing, Electronics and Maths"

Nevertheless, the Bezout bound tells us that number of zeros of a zero-dimensional system is singly-exponential in the number of variables. How should this contradiction be reconciled?

We first note that Mayr and Ritscher in 2013 showed the doubly exponential nature of Gröbner bases is with respect to the dimension of the ideal, not the number of variables. This inspires us to consider what can be done for Cylindrical Algebraic Decomposition which produces a doubly-exponential number of polynomials of doubly-exponential degree.

We review work from ISSAC 2015 which showed the number of polynomials could be restricted to doubly-exponential in the (complex) dimension using McCallum’s theory of reduced projection in the presence of equational constraints. We then discuss preliminary results showing the same for the degree of those polynomials. The results are under primitivity assumptions whose importance we illustrate.","School of Computing, Electronics and Maths"

We consider how Turing originally introduced his imitation game and discuss what this means in a practical scenario. Due to its popular appeal we also look into different representations of the test as indicated by numerous reviewers. The main emphasis here however is to consider what it actually means for a machine to pass the Turing test and what importance this has, if any. In particular does it mean that, as Turing put it, a machine can ‘think’. Specifically we consider claims that passing the Turing test means that machines will have achieved human-like intelligence and as a consequence the singularity will be upon us in the blink of an eye.,The final publication is available at Springer via http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s12559-015-9372-6","School of Computing, Electronics and Maths"

Previous studies have focused on examining the technique of free-throw shooting (Goosey-Tolfrey, Butterworth, & Morriss, 2002, Adapted Physical Activity Quarterly, 19, 238–250); however, free-throws only equate to approximately 15–22% of the total number of shots taken during a game (Gómez, Pérez, Molik, Szyman, & Sampaio, 2014, Journal of Sports Sciences, 32 (11), 1066–1075). To date, no attempts have been made to explore the determinants of two-point and three-point shooting. This study explores the key determinants of two-point and threepoint shooting and develops a valid prediction model. Following ethical approval, footage of all of the twopoint and three-point shots taken when the top five teams played each other (nine games; 1144 shots) at the 2015 Men’s European Wheelchair Basketball Championships was analysed in SportsCode (version 10, SportsTec Ltd). A valid and reliable shooting specific performance analysis template was developed by three elite wheelchair basketball coaches and the lead researcher (Inter-operator reliability ± 1: 0.00%; Intraoperator reliability ± 1: 0.00%). The template contained 61 action variables within 20 categories: Point, Quarter, Match Status, Classification, Shot Hand, Shot Handed, Shot Type, Shot Clock, Pre-Shot, Shot Movement, Shot Positioning, Zone, Pressure, Number of Defenders, Defender Marking-Shooting Hand, Defender Marking-Non-Shooting Hand, Defender Marking-Space and Defenders Positioning-Defender In Front, Defenders Positioning-Defender Behind and Defenders Positioning-Defender on Side. Chi-squared test highlighted seven categories were significant (P < 0.001) when shot outcome was compared (successful versus unsuccessful). The Shot Positioning category was the most significant category and produced a P-value of 2.2e-16. The forward selection method was used and a 30% sample of the data set selected to create a shooting specific generalised linear regression model that involved 10 categories. The model was tested against the entire data set and an area under the curve value of 0.850 was achieved. The model demonstrated that when an athlete was able to “catch and shoot” in a “square to basket” position whilst “stationary” and taking a “set shot” from the “two-point centre long” zone whilst a defender is placing “no pressure” on the shooter the individual achieved a 96.87% success rate. The findings provide objective evidence of the key determinants of shooting success. Coaches are able to utilise this information to adjust training sessions and game strategies to meet the needs of the performer.","School of Computing, Electronics and Maths"

Tsai",A hybrid model for cloud providers and consumers to agree on QoS of cloud services,"This paper describes a new agenda based approach which facilitates multi-issue negotiation process between service consumer and service provider over the quality of service (QoS) requirements in cloud services. We assume that the order of agenda (issues) has impact on the negotiation outcome, but a group of service consumers and providers may have conflicting preferences over the importance of issues. In a multiple-issue negotiation process it is difficult to reach an optimal outcome when their preferences and the relative importance of their associated issues are not known to each other. The proposed agenda based preference ordering approach helps consumers and providers to reach a consensus over the issues and to construct a common preference sequence to improve the efficiency of the issue-by-issue negotiation outcome. Consequently, a co-evolutionary negotiation model based on the result of preference ordering approach is introduced for the agents to negotiate and reach an agreement, if there is any. The contribution of the research is a new mechanism that is able to formulate issue sequence along with a co-evolutionary negotiation approach that can effectively facilitate negotiation over QoS issues in cloud computing. Finally, a case study is provided to illustrate the proposed approach.","School of Computing, Electronics and Maths"

The design outlines an approach that minimises textual and dialogic content in favour of experiential and abstract elements, reflecting existing evidence alongside the need to provide a motivation for users to engage with a wider suite of apps and technologies. Illustrating the use of “freemium” mechanics commonly used to incentivise in-app purchases as a motivator, this paper discusses their use as means towards instead incentivising the use of services to promote a healthier lifestyle. An additional mechanic sources and applies nutritional information from a large database to create a deck of food “cards”, with which the player is challenged to apply their understanding of nutrition to create in-game rewards. Preliminary findings from pre-pilot focus group evaluations with adolescents aged 14-16 (n~10) in Italy and Spain demonstrate enthusiasm for the approach taken to linking real-world behaviour with in-game rewards, as well as potential differences in reception to visual style options between sites and cultures.

The main idea is to take advantage of the fact that such structures are dissipative and that their presence should reduce the number of degrees of freedom of the flow, when paradoxically, their fine resolution incurs extra computational cost in most current methods. The principle of this method is to use a functional basis with elements that already include these fine structures so as to avoid these extra costs. This leads us to develop an algorithm to implement a spectral method for arbitrary functional bases, and in particular, non-orthogonal ones. We construct a basic implementation of this algorithm to simulate Magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) channel flows with an externally imposed, transverse magnetic field, where very thin boundary layers are known to develop along the channel walls. In this case, the sought functional basis can be built out of the eigenfunctions of the dissipation operator, which incorporate these boundary layers, and it turns out to be non-orthogonal. We validate this new scheme against numerical simulations of freely decaying MHD turbulence based on a finite volume code and it is found to provide accurate results. Its ability to fully resolve wall-bounded turbulence with a number of modes close to that required by the dynamics is demonstrated on a simple example. This opens the way to full blown simulations of MHD turbulence under very high magnetic fields. Until now such simulations were too computationally expensive. In contrast to traditional methods the computational cost of the proposed method, does not depend on the intensity of the magnetic field.

Jenko",The anisotropic redistribution of free energy for gyrokinetic plasma turbulence in a Z-pinch,"For a Z-pinch geometry, we report on the nonlinear redistribution of free energy across scales perpendicular to the magnetic guide field, for a turbulent plasma described in the framework of gyrokinetics. The analysis is performed using a local flux-surface approximation, in a regime dominated by electrostatic fluctuations driven by the entropy mode, with both ion and electron species being treated kinetically. To explore the anisotropic nature of the free energy redistribution caused by the emergence of zonal flows, we use a polar coordinate representation for the field-perpendicular directions and define an angular density for the scale flux. Positive values for the classically defined (angle integrated) scale flux, which denote a direct energy cascade, are shown to be also composed of negative angular sections, a fact that impacts our understanding of the backscatter of energy and the way in which it enters the modeling of sub-grid scales for turbulence. A definition for the flux of free energy across each perpendicular direction is introduced as well, which shows that the redistribution of energy in the presence of zonal flows is highly anisotropic.

In contrast to the USA, ethnic inequities have had little attention in research or policy in the UK and across Europe, and administrative data is limited and methodologically weak. A study of over 10% of all children on child protection plans or who were looked after in out-of-home care in England in March 2012 is reported. Children from ethnic minority categories were much more likely than ‘White’ children to be living in disadvantaged areas and this has to be taken into account when examining intervention rates. Controlling for deprivation and examining small sub-groups of the broad ethnic categories radically alters the simple understanding that ‘Black’ children are over-represented compared to White amongst children in out-of-home care, while ‘Asian’ children are under-represented. While this study could not explain these patterns it reinforces the importance of both socio-economic circumstances and ethnicity for understanding inequities in intervention rates. The evidence underlines the powerful moral and economic case for action to reduce inequities in powerful state interventions in family life, not only in England but internationally.","School of Psychological, Social and Behavioural Sciences,School of Computing, Electronics and Maths"

Using the results from an online survey we try to explore the relationships of the Affective Trajectories basic elements, namely one's current affective state, prediction of the future, and experienced outcomes following this prediction, with a set of education related emotions. The relations of these elements with flow, excitement, calm, boredom, stress, confusion, frustration and neutral linguistic emotional labels are presented and discussed. Their predictive power is evaluated by using these elements as inputs to different classification systems, and observing their performance in mapping different combinations of those elements to specific emotion labels. A data-driven fuzzy approach is utilized in order to linguistically model the underlying relations between the emotions, and the basic elements, by creating easily interpretable fuzzy rule bases. In our research we suggest that the basic elements are combined in a personalized way in order for an individual to choose a specific emotion label to describe his affective state. For this reason a fuzzy adaptive approach is also implemented, in order to demonstrate the importance of individual differences in this process, and the benefits of having a personalized system that can perpetuate modelling of emotional trajectories over learning tasks. Finally an overview and a basic implementation of an affective computing system which uses these elements are presented, and future research directions discussed.

However, unlike relational databases, the semantic graph model lacks restrictive structure. Instead, the semantic data rely on an evolving schema. This resulted in a challenge for views materialisation while allowing for open repositories of data to emerge. Open repositories combine knowledge from many different areas. Therefore, it can be assumed that various data structures within a repository may exhibit different daily access patterns, i.e. That the user interests change during the day. This research verifies this assumption and proposes a new views selection model. By analysing how access patterns of individual views contribute to the overall system workload, the proposed model aims at selection of candidates offering the highest reduction of the peak workload. The proposed selection method has been integrated as a part of a new optimisation framework, which operates as a proxy for a SPARQL-enabled database. The approach has a potential to accelerate the adaptation of views materialisation for SPARQL.

First, we propose three alternative primal models for the BTP. We also define the concepts of negative sets, negative dual rectangles, and the optimal tableau for the BTP. Next, we explore the relationships between these concepts. We also propose two greedy heuristics, based on a linear programming relaxation of the BTP model, to find some negative sets and negative dual rectangles. These two heuristics turn out to be very efficient and obtain optimal or near-optimal BTP tableaus rapidly, as confirmed by the computational experiments. Then, an adapted Ford–Fulkerson algorithm is presented and used to find an optimal solution. The two important advantages of our adapted Ford–Fulkerson algorithm over the standard Ford–Fulkerson algorithm are more flexibility and efficiency. Extensive computational results show that the growth in run-time of our hybrid algorithm, on average, is approximately a linear function of the BTP size. It has significant advantage over the transportation simplex method and on the largest problem instances it is almost five times faster. A key feature of the proposed algorithm is that it is free of degeneracy and cycling altogether.","School of Computing, Electronics and Maths"

In turn, serious games are increasingly recognized for their potential to improve education, but a typical requirement from instructors is to gain insight into how the students are playing. When we bring games into the rapidly growing online learning communities, the challenges multiply and hinder the potential effectiveness of serious games. There is a need to deliver a comprehensive, flexible and intelligent learning framework that facilitates better understanding of learners’ knowledge, effective assessment of their progress and continuous evaluation and optimization of the environments in which they learn. This paper aims to explore the potential in the use of games and learning analytics towards scaffolding and supporting teaching and learning experience. The conceptual model discussed aims to highlight key considerations that may advance the current state of learning analytics, adaptive learning and serious games, by leveraging serious games as an ideal medium for gathering data and performing adaptations. This opportunity has the potential to affect the design and deployment of education and training in the future.",

This study proposes a cascade approach that reduces the compu-tational cost of the fall detection classifier. To examine this approach, accelerometer data from 48 subjects performing a combination of falls and ordinary behaviour is used to train 3 types of classifier (J48 Decision Tree, Logistic Regression, and Multilayer Perceptron). The results show that the cas-cade approach significantly reduces the computational cost both for learning the classifier and executing it once learnt. Furthermore, the Multilayer Perceptron achieves the high-est performance with precision of 93.5%, recall of 94.2%, and f-measure of 93.5%.","School of Computing, Electronics and Maths"

VMP problem consists of two sub problems: incremental placement (VMiP) problem and consolidated placement (VMcP) problem. The goal of VMcP is to consolidate the VMs to more suitable PMs. The challenge in VMcP problem is how to find optimal solution effectively and efficiently especially when VMcP is a kind of NP-hard problem. In this paper, we present a novel solution to the VMcP problem called VMPMBBO. The proposed VMPMBBO treats VMcP problem as a complex system and utilizes the biogeography-based optimization (BBO) technique to optimize the virtual machine placement that minimizes both the resource wastage and the power consumption at the same time. Extensive experiments have been conducted using synthetic data from related literature and data from two real datasets. First of all, the necessity of VMcP has been proved by experimental results obtained by applying VMPMBBO. Then, the proposed method is compared with two existing multi-objective VMcP optimization algorithms and it is shown that VMPMBBO has better convergence characteristics and is more computationally efficient as well as robust. And then, the issue of parameter setting of the proposed method has been discussed. Finally, adaptability and extensibility of VMPMBBO have also been proved through experimental results. To the best of our knowledge, this work is the first approach that applies biogeography-based optimization (BBO) to virtual machine placement.","School of Computing, Electronics and Maths"

This study aims to converge the pedagogical benefits of role-playing, educational technology and digital games to investigate the effectiveness of using 3d digital roleplaying games (RPGs) in classrooms to improve transferal of theoretical knowledge to practice in design education. Qualitative data were collected from digital media lecturers to identify desirable learning outcomes and describe teaching and learning challenges of digital media courses. Building upon Bloom's taxonomy, feedback from lecturers informed the development of a conceptual framework in the use of digital RPGs as learning tools to achieve learning outcomes for digital media education. A 3d RPG, Virtual Designer, was developed and tested on students from two campuses of a transnational university in Vietnam and Australia. Through Virtual Designer, undergraduate Digital Media students role-played as designer practitioners in a 3d simulated workplace, applying design knowledge into different hypothetical situations. A quasi-experiment was conducted, where students completed design knowledge tests before and after intervention to evaluate students' ability to transfer theoretical knowledge into practice from the use of Virtual Designer as part of their learning journey. Students also completed surveys and participated in focus group sessions to provide input on as well as perceived benefits or drawbacks on how the use of digital RPGs impacted their learning. This paper reports results and findings acquired from the quasi-experiment, in which digital media students completed pre/post-tests before and after playing Virtual Designer in class. Paired-samples t-test was conducted. Results indicated that there are students experience statistically significant performance gains in post-tests after using Virtual Designer as a digital learning tool to reinforce design theory knowledge.","School of Computing, Electronics and Maths"

Chao",Using malware for software-defined networking–based smart home security management through a taint checking approach,"Numerous security concerns exist in smart home systems in which Internet of Things devices are connected through a home network to enable control using a centralised gateway with a handset device from the Internet. Safeguarding personal information privacy is an increasing concern in smart living services. To guarantee the mobile security of smart living services, security managers use taint checking approaches with dynamic taint propagation analysis operations to examine how a software-defined networking app uses sensitive information and investigate suspicious security vulnerabilities of devices and the effects of the spread of taint propagation over the Internet by identifying taint paths. For solving the dynamic taint propagation analysis problem, most approaches focus on cloud computing applications (apps) with malware threat analysis that involves program vulnerability analyses, rather than on the risk posed by suspicious apps connected to the cloud computing server. Accordingly, this article proposes a taint propagation analysis model incorporating a weighted spanning tree analysis scheme for tracking data with taint marking using several taint checking tools with an open software-defined networking architecture for solving the dynamic taint propagation analysis problem. In the proposed model, Android programs perform dynamic taint propagation to analyse the spread of risks posed by suspicious apps connected to the centralised gateway in a smart home system. In probabilistic risk analysis, risk and defence capability are used for each taint path to assist a defender in recognising the attack results against network threats caused by malware infection and to estimate the losses of associated taint sources. A case of threat analysis of a typical cyber security attack is presented to demonstrate the proposed approach. A new approach was used for verifying the details of an attack sequence for malware infection by incorporating a finite state machine to appropriately represent the real dynamic taint propagation analysis situations at various configuration settings and safeguard deployment. The experimental results proved that the threat analysis model enables a defender to convert the spread of taint propagation to loss and estimate the risk of a specific threat using behavioural analysis associated with 60 families of real malware. Consequently, our scheme was significantly effective in predicting the risk and loss of tainted data propagation for security concerns in smart home systems when the number of taint paths associated with the propagation rules discovered through taint analysis was increased.

To address this problem, we propose a distributed multi-wheelchair global harmonic navigation algorithm. The distinguishing features of the proposed navigation algorithm are global search and local conflict resolution abilities. In the proposed algorithm, a travel time prediction method adopts a penalty for potential conflicts based on wheelchairs׳ priority, velocity and distance between the nodes. Moreover, three harmonic rules are proposed for: (1) giving the highest priority to humans, (2) giving the highest priority to wheelchairs, (3) giving flexible priority to wheelchairs. Through extensive quantitative simulations, we explore the performance of wheelchairs in various floor plan topologies and different values for the system parameters, and demonstrate that the properties of crowded indoor environments have important influence on the performance of global navigation, such as service time. The third harmonic rule establishes the trade-off between the performance of humans and robotic wheelchairs. At the same time, physical prototype wheelchairs are implemented and they verify the proposed global harmonic navigation algorithm. Some suggestions for robotic wheelchair designers, building architects and building owners are provided based on the conclusion of the experimental results.

The dissipative particle dynamics simulations are performed in 3D space at a range of chain lengths N. The scaling laws for the end-to-end distance and gyration radius are examined first and found to hold for yielding a reasonably accurate value for the Flory exponent ν. Within the same interval of chain lengths, the asphericity, prolateness and some other shape characteristics of the chain are found to become independent of N. Their mean values are found to agree reasonably well with the respective theoretical results and lattice Monte Carlo (MC) simulations. We found the probability distribution for a wide range of shape characteristics. For the asphericity and prolateness they are quite broad, resembling in form the results of lattice MC simulations. By means of the analytic fitting of these distributions, the most probable values for the shape characteristics are found to supplement their mean values.","School of Computing, Electronics and Maths"

This observation motivates our article and definition of a Truth Table Invariant CAD (TTICAD).

In ISSAC 2013 the current authors presented an algorithm that can efficiently and directly construct a TTICAD for a list of formulae in which each has an equational constraint. This was achieved by generalising McCallum's theory of reduced projection operators. In this paper we present an extended version of our theory which can be applied to an arbitrary list of formulae, achieving savings if at least one has an equational constraint. We also explain how the theory of reduced projection operators can allow for further improvements to the lifting phase of CAD algorithms, even in the context of a single equational constraint.

The algorithm is implemented fully in Maple and we present both promising results from experimentation and a complexity analysis showing the benefits of our contributions.

Shieh, Rahat Iqbal",Type-2 Fuzzy Sets Applied to Multivariable Self-Organizing Fuzzy Logic Controllers for Regulating Anesthesia,"In this paper, novel interval and general type-2 self-organizing fuzzy logic controllers (SOFLCs) are proposed for the automatic control of anesthesia during surgical procedures. The type-2 SOFLC is a hierarchical adaptive fuzzy controller able to generate and modify its rule-base in response to the controller's performance. The type-2 SOFLC uses type-2 fuzzy sets derived from real surgical data capturing patient variability in monitored physiological parameters during anesthetic sedation, which are used to define the footprint of uncertainty (FOU) of the type-2 fuzzy sets. Experimental simulations were carried out to evaluate the performance of the type-2 SOFLCs in their ability to control anesthetic delivery rates for maintaining desired physiological set points for anesthesia (muscle relaxation and blood pressure) under signal and patient noise. Results show that the type-2 SOFLCs can perform well and outperform previous type-1 SOFLC and comparative approaches for anesthesia control producing lower performance errors while using better defined rules in regulating anesthesia set points while handling the control uncertainties. The results are further supported by statistical analysis which also show that zSlices general type-2 SOFLCs are able to outperform interval type-2 SOFLC in terms of their steady state performance.

In this work we aim to review the physical and chemical ageing mechanisms, the impact on cell performance and the factors that accelerate them. This knowledge is essential both for the battery pack design and the battery management system, and the way in which they can minimise the effects of cell ageing through controlling factors such as temperature, current and Voltage limits in an intelligent approach. This work is also the first step towards the design of an advanced cell ageing model that can be used to inform both the design of battery packs but also the battery management system. This can then be used to assess the ageing impact of usage from both vehicle and energy storage applications, in particular vehicle-to-grid interactions, ‘powerwall’ type applications and large scale energy storage. Our study was confined to Li-ion cell chemistries bounded to ageing under normal cycling conditions.

It means that the typical behaviour of a macroscopic system consisting of many interacting agents is independent of the system's structural details. This concept gains more and more popularity, not only in purely physical problems, but also in general scientific and cultural contexts. In this paper the concepts and methods of statistical physics and complex networks science are used for the detection and quantitative description of universal properties of social networks of Bylyny characters. Bylyny are heroic epics of eastern Slavs. We consider the epics covering the heyday of the Kyivan Rus (end of the tenth century to the middle of the twelfth century). By this analysis, we continue a series of works initiated in [P. Mac Carron, R. Kenna, EPL 99, 28002 (2012); P. Mac Carron, R. Kenna, Eur. Phys. J. B 86, 407 (2013)], where such quantitative methods were used to analyse several prominent European epics. The method we are using allows obtaining additional reasoning on some hypotheses about the origin of Bylyny characters and their connection to the historical figures. By comparing our results with those previously obtained, one can detect common (universal) characteristics of various epic narratives. These properties remain unchanged in time and are shared by different cultures. Thus, epics have universal properties, allowing for an additional classification based on their quantitative analysis.","School of Computing, Electronics and Maths"

The electric boundary conditions correspond to Hunt's flow with perfectly insulating walls parallel to the magnetic field (sidewalls) and perfectly conducting walls perpendicular to the magnetic field (Hartmann walls). The velocity distribution exhibits strong jets at the sidewalls, which are susceptible to instability even at low Reynolds numbers Re. We explore the onset of time-dependent flow and transition to states with evolved turbulence for a moderate Hartmann number $Ha = 100$ . At low Re time-dependence appears in the form of elongated Ting-Walker vortices at the sidewalls of the duct, which, upon increasing Re, develop into more complex structures with higher energy and then the sidewall jets partially detach from the walls. At high values of Re jet detachments disappear and the flow consists of two turbulent jets and nearly laminar core. It is also demonstrated that, there is a range of Re, where Hunt's flow exhibits a pronounced hysteresis behavior, so that different unsteady states can be observed for the same flow parameters. In this range multiple states may develop and co-exist, depending on the initial conditions.","School of Computing, Electronics and Maths"

In this article we propose a novel view-angle independent near-real time cardiorespiratory motion gating and coronary sinus (CS) catheter tracking technique for x-ray fluoroscopy images that are used to guide cardiac electrophysiology procedures. The method is based on learning CS catheter motion using principal component analysis and then applying the derived motion model to unseen images taken at arbitrary projections, using the epipolar constraint. This method is also able to track the CS catheter throughout the x-ray images in any arbitrary subsequent view. We also demonstrate the clinical application of our model on rotational angiography sequences. We validated our technique in normal and very low dose phantom and clinical datasets. For the normal dose clinical images we established average systole, end-expiration and end-inspiration gating success rates of 100%, 85.7%, and 92.3%, respectively. For very low dose applications, the technique was able to track the CS catheter with median errors not exceeding 1 mm for all tracked electrodes. Average gating success rates of 80.3%, 71.4%, and 69.2% were established for the application of the technique on clinical datasets, even with a dose reduction of more than 10 times. In rotational sequences at normal dose, CS tracking median errors were within 1.2 mm for all electrodes, and the gating success rate was 100%, for view angles from RAO 90° to LAO 90°. This view-angle independent technique can extract clinically useful cardiorespiratory motion information using x-ray doses significantly lower than those currently used in clinical practice.","School of Computing, Electronics and Maths"

Most progress has been made in arid and semi-arid climates for use in high value crop production where irrigation costs coupled with concerns regarding water scarcity have stimulated PI innovation and development. In temperate and humid climates where irrigation is supplemental to rainfall, PI is less developed but nevertheless offers scope to make more effective use of rainfall, help reduce the non-beneficial losses associated with irrigation (deep drainage, nitrate leaching) and provide farmers with evidence to demonstrate environmentally sustainable practices to processors and retailers. This paper reports on recent experiences in developing precision irrigation in UK field-scale agriculture, drawing on evidence from field research and modelling studies. By combining data from these sources, a critical evaluation focusing on selected technical, agronomic and engineering challenges that need to be overcome are described, including issues regarding PI scheduling, and the delineation of irrigation management zones to ensure compatibility with existing methods of overhead irrigation.

The main advantage of using FTF model for simulation purposes is the increased accuracy, as compared to FVM, while retaining simulation simplicity of having a reduced order model","School of Computing, Electronics and Maths,School of Mechanical, Aerospace and Automotive Engineering"

As a result of these tests, conclusions are drawn with regard to the sort of strategies which can perhaps lead to erroneous conclusions when one is involved as an interrogator.

Li",Heating performance of a solar chimney combined PCM: a numerical case study,"An experimentally validated numerical model is developed to study the effects of seven design and operational parameters on the heating performance of a solar chimney incorporated with phase change material (PCM) in this paper. It is found that when the latent heat increases from 70 to 170 kJ/kg, the melting time is increased by 103% and freezing time is prolonged by 60%. If heat flux is increased by 33%, the melting time is reduced by 36.4%. Increasing thermal conductivity of the insulation material from 0.02 to 0.06 W/m K, the melting time is prolonged by 47.2%. When absorptivity of the absorber is increased from 0.8 to 1.0, the melting time is decreased by 26.3%. When transmissivity of the glass cover is increased by 25%, the melting time is reduced by 26.7%. For the inlet air temperature, when it decreases from 25 to 15 °C, the freezing time is shortened by 39%. The melting time is only reduced by 8% when thermal conductivity of the absorber is increased by 25 times. Therefore, it can be concluded that the first six parameters have more impact on the system's performance. While the thermal conductivity of absorber slightly impacts it.

For each method, we varied the number of groups between 2, 4, 8 and 16. We then executed the MinMin Grid scheduling algorithm independently within the groups. We demonstrated that by sharing jobs and machines into groups before scheduling, the computation time for the scheduling process drastically improved by magnitudes of 85% over the ordinary MinMin algorithm when implemented on a HPC system.

Given the wide range of choices open to a game designer, including whether a game should be social, collaborative, competitive, belong to a specific genre, or be blended with other technologies such as wearable sensors, a need exists to identify success factors and translate these to underlying design principles. This paper provides a review of current literature, examining existing game-based interventions alongside the wider evidence base on interventions for lifestyle change.

Below the upper critical dimension, where the correlation length is proportional to the system length, both finite-size scaling and hyperscaling take conventional forms. Above the upper critical dimension these forms break down and a new scaling scenario appears. Here we investigate this scaling behaviour by simulating one-dimensional Ising ferromagnets with long-range interactions. We show that the correlation length scales as a non-trivial power of the linear system size and investigate the scaling forms. For interactions of sufficiently long range, the disparity between the correlation length and the system length can be made arbitrarily large, while maintaining the new scaling scenarios. We also investigate the behavior of the correlation function above the upper critical dimension and the modifications imposed by the new scaling scenario onto the associated Fisher relation.","School of Computing, Electronics and Maths"

Reframing such variations as an issue of inequity between children and between families opens the way to a new approach to explaining the profound difference in intervention rates between and within countries and administrative districts. Recent accounts of variation have frequently been based on the idea that there is a binary divide between bias and risk (or need). Here we propose seeing supply (bias) and demand (risk) factors as two aspects of a single system, both framed, in part, by social structures. A recent finding from a study of intervention rates in England, the ‘inverse intervention law’, is used to illustrate the complex ways in which a range of factors interact to produce intervention rates. In turn, this analysis raises profound moral, policy, practice and research questions about current child welfare and child protection services.

The move away from traditional paper-based course materials, registration, admissions and support services to the mobile, always-on and always accessible data has driven demand for information and generated new forms of data observable through consumption behaviours. These changes have led to a plethora of data sets that store learning content and track user behaviours. Most recently, new data analytics approaches are creating new ways of understanding trends and behaviours in students that can be used to improve learning design, strengthen student retention, provide early warning signals concerning individual students and help to personalise the learner's experience. This paper proposes a foundational learning analytics model (LAM) for higher education that focuses on the dynamic interaction of stakeholders with their data supported by visual analytics, such as self-organising maps, to generate conversations, shared inquiry and solution-seeking. The model can be applied for other educational institutions interested in using learning analytics processes to support personalised learning and support services.

This optimal emerges at a threshold disturbance energy below which a nonlinear version of the known (streamwise-independent) linear optimal [P. J. Schmid and D. S. Henningson, “Optimal energy density growth in Hagen-Poiseuille flow,” J. Fluid Mech. 277, 192–225 (1994)] is selected and appears to remain the optimal up until the critical energy at which transition is triggered. The form of this optimal is similar to that found in short pipes [Pringle et al., “Minimal seeds for shear flow turbulence: Using nonlinear transient growth to touch the edge of chaos,” J. Fluid Mech. 702, 415–443 (2012)], but now with full localisation in the streamwise direction. This fully localised optimal perturbation represents the best approximation yet of the minimal seed (the smallest perturbation which is arbitrarily close to states capable of triggering a turbulent episode) for “real” (laboratory) pipe flows. Dependence of the optimal with respect to several parameters has been computed and establishes that the structure is robust.

This allows us to extensively study the modularity distribution in ensembles of Erdős-Rényi networks, producing theoretical predictions for means and variances inclusive of finite-size corrections.

Degree correlations also affect the dynamics of processes supported by a network structure, such as the spread of opinions or epidemics. The proper modelling of these systems, i.e., without uncontrolled biases, requires the sampling of networks with a specified set of constraints. We present a solution to the sampling problem when the constraints imposed are the degree correlations. In particular, we develop an efficient and exact method to construct and sample graphs with a specified joint-degree matrix, which is a matrix providing the number of edges between all the sets of nodes of a given degree, for all degrees, thus completely specifying all pairwise degree correlations, and additionally, the degree sequence itself. Our algorithm always produces independent samples without backtracking.

However, its small field of view and acoustic artifacts make direct automatic segmentation of the catheters very challenging. In this study, a fast catheter segmentation framework for echocardiographic imaging guided by the segmentation of corresponding X-ray fluoroscopic imaging is proposed. The complete framework consists of: 1) catheter initialization in the first X-ray frame; 2) catheter tracking in the rest of the X-ray sequence; 3) fast registration of corresponding X-ray and ultrasound frames; and 4) catheter segmentation in ultrasound images guided by the results of both X-ray tracking and fast registration. The main contributions include: 1) a Kalman filter-based growing strategy with more clinical data evalution; 2) a SURF detector applied in a constrained search space for catheter segmentation in ultrasound images; 3) a two layer hierarchical graph model to integrate and smooth catheter fragments into a complete catheter; and 4) the integration of these components into a system for clinical applications. This framework is evaluated on five sequences of porcine data and four sequences of patient data comprising more than 3000 X-ray frames and more than 1000 ultrasound frames. The results show that our algorithm is able to track the catheter in ultrasound images at 1.3 s per frame, with an error of less than 2 mm. However, although this may satisfy the accuracy for visualization purposes and is also fast, the algorithm still needs to be further accelerated for real-time clinical applications.","School of Computing, Electronics and Maths"

We conclude that the performance of flow-state DSR is better than DSR in the presence of all attacks. Flooding attacks are found to dramatically impact all the standard performance metrics. Blackhole attacks significantly worse the packet delivery ratio in a static network using unmodified DSR.

The proposed classifier can properly classify multi-class data with complex and variously shaped decision boundaries among the different classes of faults and the fault-free state, and is robust against noise. This is due mainly to the fact that the classifier is constructed using the fuzzy-neighborhood density based clustering method, which is not sensitive to the geometrical shape of clusters in the feature space.

Because children with attention deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) tend to have fewer problems with concentration and engagement when playing digital games, applying game technologies and design approaches to complement treatment may be a useful means to engage this population in their treatment. Unfortunately, gamified training programs currently available for ADHD have been limited in their ability to demonstrate in-game behavior skills that generalize to daily life situations. Therefore, we developed a new serious game (called “Plan-It Commander”) that was specifically designed to promote behavioral learning and promotes strategy use in domains of daily life functioning such as time management, planning/organizing, and prosocial skills that are known to be problematic for children with ADHD. An interdisciplinary team contributed to the development of the game. The game's content and approach are based on psychological principles from the Self-Regulation Model, Social Cognitive Theory, and Learning Theory. In this article, game development and the scientific background of the behavioral approach are described, as well as results of a survey (n = 42) to gather user feedback on the first prototype of the game. The findings suggest that participants were satisfied with this game and provided the basis for further development and research to the game. Implications for developing serious games and applying user feedback in game development are discussed.

The study was performed in the weakly inertial limit by means of an asymptotic expansion, which is valid for any Hartmann number. We show that the dimensionality of the leading order can be fully described using the single parameter lνz/h, where lνz represents the distance over which the Lorentz force is able to act before being balanced by viscous dissipation. The base flow happens to introduce inertial recirculations in the meridional plane at the first order, which are shown to follow two radically different mechanisms: inverse Ekman pumping driven by a vertical pressure gradient along the axis of the vortex, or direct Ekman pumping driven by a radial pressure gradient in the Hartmann boundary layers. We demonstrate that when the base flow is quasi-2D, the relative importance of direct and inverse pumping is solely determined by the aspect ratio η/h, where η refers to the width of the vortex. Of the two mechanisms, only inverse pumping appears to act as a significant source of helicity.","School of Computing, Electronics and Maths"

We tested Snort's analysis performance, gauging the number of packets sent, analysed, dropped, filtered, injected, and outstanding. We suggest using QoS configuration technologies in a Cisco Catalyst 3560 Series Switch and parallel Snorts to improve NIDPS performance and to reduce the number of dropped packets. Our results show that our novel configuration improves performance.

However, such schemes determine the degree of QoS satisfaction using fuzzy set membership functions, and cannot therefore take negative evidence (i.e., consumer dissatisfaction) into account. By contrast, vague sets provide the ability to represent both positive and negative evidence when modeling uncertain objects. Accordingly, the present study proposes a new satisfaction-based Web service ranking method for QSDS problems involving a group of online service consumers with imprecise and inconsistent expectations and degrees of satisfaction regarding multiple QoS criteria. Importantly, the proposed approach overcomes the uncertainty regarding the difference between the users’ expectations and their degree of satisfaction inherent in Dempster–Shafer (D-S) evidence theory.

This approach takes advantage of the model reduction procedure’s ability to reduce a complex rotor structure to a single equivalent loop without significant loss of accuracy. An alternative method based on winding factors has also been developed and includes coupling via harmonic fields. Parameters determined in both ways are in close agreement with those determined from Finite Element Analysis (FEA) and experimentally.

Dubois",Rational Partial Choice Functions and Their Application to Belief Revision,"Necessary and sufficient conditions for choice functions to be rational have been intensively studied in the past. However, in these attempts, a choice function is completely specified. That is, given any subset of options, called an issue, the best option over that issue is always known, whilst in real-world scenarios, it is very often that only a few choices are known instead of all. In this paper, we study partial choice functions and investigate necessary and sufficient rationality conditions for situations where only a few choices are known. We prove that our necessary and sufficient condition for partial choice functions boils down to the necessary and sufficient conditions for complete choice functions proposed in the literature. Choice functions have been instrumental in belief revision theory. That is, in most approaches to belief revision, the problem studied can simply be described as the choice of possible worlds compatible with the input information, given an agent’s prior belief state. The main effort has been to devise strategies in order to infer the agents revised belief state. Our study considers the converse problem: given a collection of input information items and their corresponding revision results (as provided by an agent), does there exist a rational revision operation used by the agent and a consistent belief state that may explain the observed results?","School of Computing, Electronics and Maths"

Existing software systems continue to evolve to progressively reach important qualities such as completeness and correctness. Iterative refinements and incremental developments are considered to be,well suitable for the development of evolving systems among other approaches. The problem with iterative refinements and incremental development is the lack of support of an adequate verification process. In general, all the proofs are redone after every evolution, which is very expensive in terms of cost and time. In this work, we propose a slicing based solution to add an adequate verification process to iterative refinements and incremental development technique. Our proposal has two objectives, the first is to perform verification only on those parts that may influence the property satisfaction by the analyzed model. The second is to classify the evolutions and properties to identify which evolutions require re-verification. We argue that for the class of evolutions that requires re-verification, instead of verifying the whole system only a part that is concerned by the property would be sufficient. We use Petri nets as a modeling formalism and model checking as a verification approach to show the viability of the proposed approach.","School of Computing, Electronics and Maths"

recent distribution data. It is much rarer to see evaluations of population change over the longer–term in order
to extend the baseline back in time. Here, we use two methods (regression analysis and line of equality) to
identify long-term differences in abundance derived from qualitative descriptions, and we test the efficacy of
this approach by comparison with contemporary data. We take descriptions of bird population abundance in
Cambridgeshire, UK, from the first half of the 19th century and compare these with more recent estimates by
converting qualitative descriptions to an ordinal scale. We show, first, that the ordinal scale of abundance corresponds
well to quantitative estimates of density and range size based on current data, and, second, that the
two methods of comparison revealed both increases and declines in species, some of which were consistent
using both approaches but others showed differing responses. We also show that the regional rates of extinction
(extirpation) for birds are twice as high as equivalent rates for plants. These data extend analyses of avifaunal
change back to a baseline 160-190 years before present, thus bringing a novel perspective on long-term change
in populations and categories of conservation concern (e.g., Amber- or Red-lists) based on recent data. Changes
in status are discussed in relation to various factors, although perhaps the most pervasive were of anthropogenic

Furthermore, as part of enhancing learning, the game intends to provide knowledge and awareness on sustainability issues for public constructions relevant to engineering and architectural disciplines. Deployed targeted questionnaires with thirty-three (33) computer science students in UK and analysed through a Likert Scale findings from evaluation demonstrate that a conceptual change may be achieved in relation to how sustainability has been perceived. A questionnaire with 20 questions was distributed to students for evaluating various elements of the game such as usability characteristics, accumulation, assimilation and consolidation of new knowledge patterns related to the learning-oriented benefits of the game with an implicit focus on whether the game can be integrated within an academic setting. The fundamental conclusion from the analysis of the game uptake is that it enhances student's engagement with sustainability issues, especially in blended learning contexts for `blending' different pedagogical approaches with game-oriented features as means of improving educational practice.",

The concept of a ""job for life"" at a single organization is becoming less prevalent across sectors and cultures. In such a context, traditional approaches to career guidance, which often focused upon identifying a suitable occupation for adolescents at an early stage and establishing a route towards it, are being challenged with the need to communicate the value of transferrable skills and non-linear progression paths.

Implementing the scheduling algorithms simultaneously within paired groups (multi-scheduling) ensures a high degree of parallelism, increases throughput and improves the overall performance of scheduling algorithms.

Rho",Optimized clustering for data dissemination using stochastic coalition game in vehicular cyber-physical systems,"Vehicular cyber-physical systems (VCPS) have emerged as one of the most powerful technologies for providing cost-effective services to the end users with minimum delay even with high mobility of the end users. As the contact time of the vehicles with the nearest access points is very less, so by integrating vehicles with the cloud environment can provide various services to the end users even with their high mobility. Keeping focus on these points, this paper proposed a new optimized strategy selection for data dissemination using a stochastic coalition game in VCPS environment. Vehicles in the coalition game are assumed as the players of the game which access a finite number of resources from the cloud. Learning automata (LA) stationed on the vehicles collect and process the information from the environment based upon pre-defined strategies. They are assumed to form a coalition based upon predictive clustering among one another using a pre-defined metric. Based upon the payoff matrix, each player executes, algorithms for cluster and leadership formation. Moreover, an algorithm for centralized supervision is also designed. At any instant in the game, only those players are allowed to make a move which are having highest payoff value so as to make a balance with respect to the moves taken by all the players in the game. The performance of the proposed scheme is evaluated using various evaluation metrics in different network scenarios. The results obtained show that the proposed scheme is better than the case where it is not applied. Specifically, there is an increase of 10–20 % in packet delivery ratio and 20 % reduction in delay in accessing various services from the cloud using the proposed scheme.","School of Computing, Electronics and Maths"

In order to gain insight into the convection taking place in the Earth’s tangent cylinder, we target regimes of asymptotically strong rotation. The critical Rayleigh number Rac and critical wavenumber ac are computed numerically by solving the linear stability problem in a systematic way, with either stress-free or no-slip kinematic boundary conditions. A parametric study is conducted, varying the Ekman number E (ratio of viscous to Coriolis forces) and the Elsasser number Λ (ratio of the Lorentz force to the Coriolis force). E is varied from 10−9
to 10−2 and Λ from 10−3 to 1. For a wide range of thermal and magnetic Prandtl numbers, our results verify and confirm previous experimental and theoretical results showing the existence of two distinct unstable modes at low values of E–one being controlled by the magnetic field, the other being controlled by viscosity (often called the viscous mode). It is shown that oscillatory onset does not occur in the range of parameters we are interested in. Asymptotic scalings for the onset of these modes are numerically confirmed and their domain of validity is precisely quantified. We show that with no-slip boundary conditions, the asymptotic behavior is reached for E < 10−6 and establish a map in the (E,Λ) plane. We distinguish regions where convection sets in either through the magnetic mode or through the viscous mode. Our analysis gives the regime in which the transition between magnetic and viscous modes may be observed.

Siloxane breakthrough curves within this article identified that upon approaching media exhaustion, a concentration of 30 mg/m3 was reached within a short time frame. Consequently, changepoint analysis was evaluated as a method to predict the onset of breakthrough. Breakthrough data were collated from vessels that exhibited both broad‐fronted and sharp‐fronted breakthrough profiles. When applied to broad‐fronted profiles, changepoint analysis provided a 25–45 h early warning of breakthrough. In this case, probabilistic changepoint detection methods facilitated by on‐line analysis provide sufficient process lag time to enable duty/standby switch over before the critical siloxane concentration is reached.","School of Computing, Electronics and Maths"

In the warning dissemination phase, uncertainty in the household?s behaviour as ?warning informants? has been investigated along with uncertainties in the warning system. An agentbased model (ABM) was developed for ESF-1 with households as agents and ?warning informants? behaviour as the agent behaviour. The model was used to study warning dissemination effectiveness under various conditions of the official channel. In the transportation phase, uncertainties in the household?s behaviour such as departure time (a function of ESF-1), means of transport and destination have been. Households could evacuate as pedestrians, using car or evacuation buses. An ABM was developed to study the evacuation performance (measured in evacuation travel time). In this thesis, a holistic approach for planning the public evacuation shelters called ?Shelter Information Management System? (SIMS) has been developed. A generic allocation framework of was developed to available shelter capacity to the shelter demand by considering the evacuation travel time. This was formulated using integer programming. In the sheltering phase, the uncertainty in household shelter choices (either nearest/allocated/convenient) has been studied for its impact on allocation policies using sensitivity analyses. Using analyses from the models and detailed examination of household states from ?warning to safety?, it was found that the three ESFs though sequential in time, however have lot of interdependencies from the perspective of evacuation planning.

It is essential but also inherently difficult to accurately and rapidly calculate the cross-sectional properties of a complex composite blade for the structural dynamics and aeroelasticity analysis of the blade. In this paper, a novel mathematical model for calculating the cross-sectional properties of composite blades has been developed by incorporating classical lamination theory (CLT) with extended Bredt-Batho shear flow theory (EBSFT). The mathematical model considers the shear web effects and warping effects of composite blades thus greatly improves the accuracy of torsional stiffness calculation compared with the results from direct use of 3D laminate theories. It also avoids complicated post-processing of force-displacement data from computationally expensive 3D finite-element analysis (FEA) thus considerably improves the computational efficiency. A Matlab program was developed to verify the accuracy and efficiency of the mathematical model and a series of benchmark calculation tests were undertaken. The results show that good agreement is achieved comparing with the data from experiment and FEA, and improved accuracy of torsional stiffness calculation due to consideration of the shear web effects is observed comparing with an existing cross-sectional analysis code PreComp.","School of Computing, Electronics and Maths"

Ghani, M.A. Ismail",An artificial neural network classification approach for improving accuracy of customer identification in e-commerce,"With the advances in Web-based oriented technologies, experts are able to capture user activities on the Web. Users’ Web browsing behavior is used for user identification. Identifying users during their activities is extremely important in electronic commerce (e-Commerce)as it has the potential to prevent illegal transactions or activities particularly for users who enter the system through the use of unknown methods.In addition, customer behavioral pattern identification provides a wide spectrum of applications such as personalized Web pages, product recommendations and present advertisements. In this research, a framework for users’ behavioral profiling formation is presented and customer behavioral patterns are used for customer identification in the e-Commerce environment. Based on activity control, policies such as user restriction or blocking can be applied.The neural network classification and the measure of similarity among behavioral patterns are two approaches applied in this research. The results of multi-layer perceptron with a back propagation learning algorithm indicate that there is less error and up to 15.12% more accuracy on average.The results imply that the accuracy of the neural network approach in customer pattern behavior recognition increases when the number of customers grows.In contrast, the accuracy of the similarity of pattern method decreases.","School of Computing, Electronics and Maths"

Lohse",Wake-Driven Dynamics of Finite-Sized Buoyant Spheres in Turbulence,"Particles suspended in turbulent flows are affected by the turbulence and at the same time act back on the flow. The resulting coupling can give rise to rich variability in their dynamics. Here we report experimental results from an investigation of finite-sized buoyant spheres in turbulence. We find that even a marginal reduction in the particle’s density from that of the fluid can result in strong modification of its dynamics. In contrast to classical spatial filtering arguments and predictions of particle models, we find that the particle acceleration variance increases with size. We trace this reversed trend back to the growing contribution from wake-induced forces, unaccounted for in current particle models in turbulence. Our findings highlight the need for improved multiphysics based models that account for particle wake effects for a faithful representation of buoyant-sphere dynamics in turbulence.

The paper reports on data for 99,683 players over 315,882 discrete logins, supplemented by results from a nationally-representative survey of children at UK schools (n=1,108), an incentivized survey of the player-base (n=1,028), and qualitative data obtained through a series of one-to-one interviews aged 9-14 (n=28). Analysis demonstrates the reach of the game to its target demographic, with 88.13% of players within the UK. A 3.94 male/female ratio was observed amongst players surveyed, with an age distribution across the target range of 9-15. Noting mean and median playtimes of 93 and 31 minutes (n=99,683), it is suggested such an approach to user engagement and retention can surpass typical contact times obtained through other forms of web-based content. The size of the player-base attracted to the game and players' qualitative feedback demonstrates the potential for serious games deployed on a national scale.

conjugate gradient Temporal Difference (TD, TD-conj) methods. It builds on the fact that TD-conj was proven to be equivalent to a gradient TD method with a variable lambda under certain conditions. Based on straightforward features extraction process combined with goal-aware capabilities provided by whole image measure, the model solves what we call u-turn-homing benchmark problem without using landmarks. Only one goal snapshot was used with agent facing the goal directly. Therefore a novel threshold stopping formula was used to recognize the goal which is less sensitive to the agent-goal orientation problem. Unlike other models, this model refrains from artificially manipulating or assuming a priori knowledge about the environment, two constraints that widely restrict the applicability of existing models in realistic scenarios. An on-line control method was used to train a set of neural networks. With the aid of variable and fixed eligibility traces, these networks approximate the agent’s action-value function allowing it to take close to optimal actions to reach its home. The effectiveness of the model was experimentally verified on an agent.

Moreover, people trust such connections and readily use them to transfer sensitive information. With an explosive increase of their use we need expand the aspect of evaluating the security issues wireless networks. Majority of household are using the latest secured protocols the WPA2 with a government grade standard nowadays. These protocols are still vulnerable to dictionary attacks that are normally carried out by recording three-way handshakes between the wireless router and the connected client. This method is really common and widely used - its success depends on the strength of the password being used. The research presented here shows another efficient method of hijacking and breaking into home networks is by using a Man-in-the-Middle type attack. The proposed system is implemented on a Raspberry Pi carried by a drone. While until recently UAV's (Unmanned Aerial Vehicles) have been used mainly by militaries and some specialist organisations, nowadays they have become widely available, cheaper and user friendly. The use of a drone allows the system to cover a wide area of potential targets as well as relatively quickly move from one target and WiFi network to another. The system is based on war flying using commercially available drones (Wang, 2006). The main goal of this project is to be able to hijack a wireless connection session between a connected tablet PC and Access Point using WPA2 encryption. We will be able to automate a Man in the Middle attack just by flying the drone around a certain area, setting up a rogue access point and being able to harvest important credentials from the targeted wireless networks and connected devices. The system is based on a number of open source Wi-Fi penetration testing and configuration tools including iwconfig or airmon-ng and custom scripts. The drone payload (Raspberry Pi B+) is using two wireless dongles; one for monitoring the wireless networks and the other one for being the rogue access point. The Raspberry Pi is powered by a 1000 mAh battery and carried by a DJI Phantom Drone. The device is also capable of other types of attacks. Such as disconnecting devices from its currently connected networks or causing denial of service attack against wireless routers/hubs while remaining stealthy to the victim(s) and operating from a distance.","School of Computing, Electronics and Maths"

Here we show that, as for regular lattices, the celebrated Lee-Yang circle theorem is obeyed for the former case. However, unlike on regular lattices where it is independent of dimensionality, the circle theorem fails on complex networks when $\lambda <5$ .

Contrary to the abundance of models that use two neural networks one for the actor and one for the critic, this model sets up the actor as a layer seconded by another layer which deduce the value function. Therefore, the effect is to have similar to a critic outcome combined with the actor in one network. Hence, the model paves the way for a deep reinforcement learning architecture for future work The reward signal is back propagated through the critic then the actor. At the same time, the features layer have been deeply trained by applying a simple PCA on the whole set of images histograms acquired during the first running episode. The model is then able to shrink the whole architecture to fit a new reduced features dimension. Initial experimental result on real robot shows that the agent accomplished good level of accuracy and efficacy in reaching the goal.

In determining the risk of taint propagation, risk and defence capability are used for each taint path for assisting a defender in recognising the attack results against network threats caused by malware infection and estimate the losses of associated taint sources. Finally, a case of threat analysis of a typical cyber security attack is presented to demonstrate the proposed approach. Our approach verified the details of an attack sequence for malware infection by incorporating a finite state machine (FSM) to appropriately reflect the real situations at various configuration settings and safeguard deployment. The experimental results proved that the threat analysis model allows a defender to convert the spread of taint propagation to loss and practically estimate the risk of a specific threat by using behavioural analysis with real malware infection.","School of Computing, Electronics and Maths"

Shaikh",Towards a knowledge-based approach for effective decision making in railway safety,"Purpose: This paper contributes towards understanding how safety knowledge can be elicited from railway experts for the purposes of supporting effective decision making. 

Design/methodology/approach: A consortium of safety experts from across the British railway industry is formed. Collaborative modelling of the knowledge domain is used as an approach to the elicitation of safety knowledge from experts. From this a series of knowledge models is derived to inform decision making. This is achieved by using Bayesian networks as a knowledge modelling scheme underpinning a safety prognosis tool to serve meaningful prognostics information and visualise such information to predict safety violations. 

Findings: Collaborative modelling of safety-critical knowledge is a valid approach to knowledge elicitation and its sharing across the railway industry. This approach overcomes some of the key limitations of existing approaches to knowledge elicitation. Such models become an effective tool for prediction of safety cases by using railway data. This is demonstrated using Passenger-Train Interaction safety data. 


Practical implications: This study contributes to practice in two main directions: by documenting an effective approach to knowledge elicitation and knowledge sharing, while also helping the transport industry to understand safety. 

Social implications: By supporting the railway industry in their efforts to understand safety this research has the potential to benefit railway passengers, staff and communities in general, which is a priority for the transport sector. 

Originality/value: This research applies a knowledge elicitation approach to understanding safety based on collaborative modelling, which is a novel approach in the context of transport.

We show that combining neural activity across two brains increases accuracy to guide evolutionary search more effectively. The IGA system involves a simple task of evolving a polygon shape to approximate the shape of a target polygon. Two candidates visually inspected the evolved polygons and mentally ranked them (independently from each other) from 1×10 based on their similarity to the target polygon. In parallel, the IGA system evaluated the fitness of evolved polygons using a standard fitness function. The IGA system was run for a few generations, before evolution was paused and EEG signals were collected from the two candidates. The collected EEG signals were used to train a regression model that received unseen EEG as input and mapped this into fitness values. The trained model was then used to guide the IGA solely by using the EEG signals. Off-line experimental results showed that it was possible to build better regression models that are trained using two EEG signals to capture participants evaluation of fitness. This paper demonstrates the possibility of a new domain of applications for interactive evolution where standard fitness calculations can be replaced with multiple EEG signals for guiding an optimisation process.","School of Computing, Electronics and Maths"

Menzel",Tolerance of alien plant species to extreme events is comparable to that of their native relatives,"In addition to increases in temperature and CO2, other features of climate change, such as extreme events and short-term variations in climate are thought to be important. Some evidence indicates that invasive plant species might benefit from climate change via these features. However, apart from theory-based predictions, knowledge of the tolerance of invasive species to short-term climatic stress is very limited. We investigated whether three naturalized alien plant species in central Europe, Ambrosia artemisiifolia, Hieracium aurantiacum and Lysimachia punctata perform better under stressful conditions than comparable native species. A greenhouse experiment with a fixed stress sequence of frost, drought and water logging was set up. We applied this stress treatment to two life history stages (seedling and adult plants), plants grown in monoculture (mild intraspecific competition) and in a highly competitive setting with intra- and interspecific competition. Whilst small differences in plant responses were detected the alien species overall were not more tolerant to stress. The responses of alien and native congeners/confamilials to stress in all treatments (monoculture, competition, adult, seedling) were similar, which indicates that stress thresholds are phylogenetically conserved. All species were more vulnerable to stress at the seedling stage and when subject to competition. Our data indicates that results obtained from experiments using onlymonocultures and one development stage are not appropriate for drawing generalizations about lethal thresholds. Moreover, rather abrupt species-specific thresholds exist, which indicates that a prediction of species responses based on just two stress levels, as is the case in most studies, is not sufficient.","School of Computing, Electronics and Maths"

However, there is no research on performance models for the Hadoop Distributed File System (HDFS). Due to the complexity of HDFS and the difficulty of modeling the multiple impact factors for HDFS performance, to establish HDFS performance models based directly on these impact factors is very complicated. In this paper, the relationship between file size and HDFS Write/Read (denoted as W/R for short) throughput, i.e., the average flow rate of a HDFS W/R operation, is studied to build HDFS performance models from a systematic view. Based on the measured data of specially designed experiments (in which HDFS W/R operations can be viewed as single-input single-output systems), a system identification-based approach is applied to construct performance models for HDFS W/R operations under different conditions. Furthermore, dynamic characteristics metrics for HDFS performance are defined, and based on the identified performance models and these metrics, the dynamic characteristics of HDFS W/R operations, such as steady state and overshoot, are studied, and the relationships between impact factors and dynamic characteristics are analyzed. These analysis results can provide effective guidance and implications for the design and configuration of HDFS and Hadoop-based applications.","School of Computing, Electronics and Maths"

Anane,The Impact of Learning Style Adaptivity in Teaching Computer Security,"Teaching computer security is one of the most challenging tasks in computer science, because of the need to successfully integrate abstract concepts and practical applications. Several e-learning systems have been developed to address this issue. However, they usually provide the same material in the same sequence irrespective of the characteristics of the students, such as their knowledge level and learning style. In this paper, an approach to learning style adaptivity is proposed for the teaching of computer security. An e-learning system was developed to provide more personalised and adaptive learning, based on the information perception style of the Felder-Silverman model. This is the dimension of learning style, which has received the least attention in published research. In the approach, a personalised sequence of learning material is generated based on an individual learning style. The approach is evaluated in order to determine its effectiveness in learning provision. An experiment conducted with sixty subjects produced significant results. They indicate that matching computer security learning material, according to the learning style of the students, yields significantly better learning gain and student satisfaction than without matching

The PAM is an actuator characterized by a decrease in the actuating length when pressurized. Its nonlinear nature and time-varying parameters cause difficulties in modeling their characteristics, as well as in designing controllers for high-performance positioning systems. A constrained linear and piecewise affine system model approximation is formulated, and a control scheme composed of the following is being synthesized: 1) a feedforward term regulating the control input at specific set points and 2) a constrained finite-time optimal controller handling any deviations from the system's equilibrium points. Extended experimental studies are utilized to prove the efficacy of the suggested controller.","School of Computing, Electronics and Maths"

However, both the marketplace and career paths are becoming increasingly dynamic, with employees more frequently moving between sectors and positions than was the case for previous generations. The concept of a “job for life” at a single organization is becoming less prevalent across sectors and cultures. In such a context, traditional approaches to career guidance, which often focused upon identifying a suitable occupation for adolescents at an early stage and establishing a route towards it, are being challenged with the need to communicate the value of transferrable skills and non-linear progression paths. This article explores the role digital games might play in allowing learners to develop these skills as part of a wider careers guidance programme. Through a case study of the “MeTycoon” serious game, the potential reach of such games is discussed, with 38,097 visits to the game's website, and 408,247 views of embedded educational videos.

Data intensive applications running on a public cloud have been shown to exhibit degraded performance compared to a private cluster. This performance degradation is as a result of the inefficient resource allocation adopted in a virtualized, volatile and multi-tenancy environment such as a cloud. The placement of virtual machines is critical for improving performance in geo-clouds environment. We address degradation in performance by designing a scheduling algorithm that dynamically distributes virtual machines based on the characteristics of the job, the network characteristics and the real time performance of the data centers. Our algorithm also finds the best node(s) to host virtual machines that will yield maximum resource utilization and minimize bandwidth consumption. Our results show that incorporating these characteristics in a resource scheduling algorithm increases the performance of data intensive application than known traditional scheduling.","School of Computing, Electronics and Maths"

While transesophageal echocardiography allows for high-quality visualization of cardiac anatomy, X-ray fluoroscopy provides excellent visualization of devices. We have developed a novel image fusion system that allows real-time integration of 3-D echocardiography and the X-ray fluoroscopy. The system was validated in the following two stages: 1) preclinical to determine function and validate accuracy; and 2) in the clinical setting to assess clinical workflow feasibility and determine overall system accuracy. In the preclinical phase, the system was assessed using both phantom and porcine experimental studies. Median 2-D projection errors of 4.5 and 3.3 mm were found for the phantom and porcine studies, respectively. The clinical phase focused on extending the use of the system to interventions in patients undergoing either atrial fibrillation catheter ablation (CA) or transcatheter aortic valve implantation (TAVI). Eleven patients were studied with nine in the CA group and two in the TAVI group. Successful real-time view synchronization was achieved in all cases with a calculated median distance error of 2.2 mm in the CA group and 3.4 mm in the TAVI group. A standard clinical workflow was established using the image fusion system. These pilot data confirm the technical feasibility of accurate real-time echo-fluoroscopic image overlay in clinical practice, which may be a useful adjunct for real-time guidance during interventional cardiac procedures.","School of Computing, Electronics and Maths"

We demonstrate that a scheme estimating the channel using pilot symbols and detecting the message using nearest neighbor decoding (while assuming that the channel estimation is perfect) essentially achieves the capacity pre-log of non-coherent multiple-input single-output flat-fading channels, and it essentially achieves the best so far known lower bound on the capacity pre-log of non-coherent MIMO flat-fading channels.

In total, 1129 elite footballers, representing 43 countries across six FIFA confederations completed the questionnaire. Exploratory analysis of overall responses revealed that the players had strong opinions with regards to surface properties when directly comparing natural and football turf. In particular, a higher proportion of players stated that football turf was “Too hard/Harder”, “More/level”, “More abrasive” and had “Less grip” compared to natural grass. The results also showed that overall players’ perceptions of surface properties, between natural grass and football turf were dependent on their experience of different playing surfaces during their junior and senior careers, in particular, the variability within football turf pitches.","School of Computing, Electronics and Maths"

Machine Learning approaches with their ability to learn from and adapt to their environments provide a promising approach to modelling and protecting against security threats on mobile devices. This paper presents a comparative study and implementation of Decision Trees and Neural Network models for the detection of port scanning showing the differences between the responses on a desktop platform and a mobile device and the ability of the Neural Network model to adapt to the different environment and computational resource available on a mobile platform.","School of Computing, Electronics and Maths"

Due to privacy issues however, it might be difficult to extract user data from social network, in particu- lar location data. For instance, information on user location depends on users’ agreement to share own ge- ographic data. Instead of directly collecting personal user information, we aim to infer user preferences by detecting behavior patterns from publicly available micro blogging content and users’ followers’ network. With statistical and machine-learning methods, we employ Twitter-specific features to predict country origin of users on Twitter with an accuracy of more than 90% for users from the most active countries. We further investigate users’ interpersonal communi- cation with their followers. Our findings reveal that belonging to a particular cultural group is playing an important role in increasing users responses to their friends. The knowledge on user cultural origins thus could provide a differentiated state-of-the-art user ex- perience in microblogs, for instance, in friend recom- mendation scenario.","School of Computing, Electronics and Maths"

One basic network property that relates to the structure of the links found is the degree assortativity, which is a measure of the correlation between the degrees of the nodes at the end of the links. Degree correlations are known to affect both the structure of a network and the dynamics of the processes supported thereon, including the resilience to damage, the spread of information and epidemics, and the efficiency of defence mechanisms. Nonetheless, while many studies focus on undirected scale-free networks, the interactions in real-world systems often have a directionality. Here, we investigate the dependence of the degree correlations on the power-law exponents in directed scale-free networks. To perform our study, we consider the problem of building directed networks with a prescribed degree distribution, providing a method for proper generation of power-law-distributed directed degree sequences. Applying this new method, we perform extensive numerical simulations, generating ensembles of directed scale-free networks with exponents between 2 and 3, and measuring ensemble averages of the Pearson correlation coefficients. Our results show that scale-free networks are on average uncorrelated across directed links for three of the four possible degree-degree correlations, namely in-degree to in-degree, in-degree to out-degree, and out-degree to out-degree. However, they exhibit anticorrelation between the number of outgoing connections and the number of incoming ones. The findings are consistent with an entropic origin for the observed disassortativity in biological and technological networks.","School of Computing, Electronics and Maths"

In this paper we present a new method which applies differential evolution, one of the main bio-inspired optimization algorithms, on a time series k-means clustering task to set the weights of the distance metrics used in a combination that is used to cluster the time series. The weights are obtained by applying an optimization process that gives optimal clustering quality. We show through extensive experiments how this optimized combination outperforms all the other stand-alone distance metrics, all by keeping the same low complexity of the distance metrics used in the combination.","School of Computing, Electronics and Maths"

The charging and discharging periods are crucially important for improving the efficiency of the PV battery. An optimal control scheme for energy storage systems in LV networks is introduced to facilitate demand response (DR). The method described also regulates thermal violation and voltage violation caused by PV generation. Finally, the paper uses a five node LV network and typical household profiles to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed control strategy.

We have now explored operating schemes to provide accurate short pulses of high radiance light in an intensity modulation scheme for the purpose of retinal prosthesis. We have shown that by utilizing the sparse nature of retinal code, it is possible to have an adaptive system which minimizes information transfer compared to raster or purely asynchronous bit serial modes.

The sensor system is designed to operate in a dual configuration in which one resonator is coated with a gas- sensitive polymer (polyethylene) coating, whilst the second one is used as a reference channel; thereby eliminating common mode interferences on the baseline signal.

The EWV transition filters proposed here increase the classification accuracy by 1% over unfiltered results in realistic scenarios and significantly reduces spurious classifier output in real-time visualizations. A 200 fold transmission reduction from the on-body system to an outside system was achieved in practice by combining the transition filters with an event-based design. Furthermore, a method of reducing transmissions between on-body data gathering nodes based on distributed processing of the classifier rules (but maintaining a one-way flow of communications during system use) is also described. This provides a 3.3 fold reduction in packets and a 13.5 fold reduction in data transmitted from one node to the other in a two-node wearable system.","School of Computing, Electronics and Maths"

Since several users and systems may coexist in these environments, it is quite possible that entities with opposing preferences need to cooperate to reach their respective goals. Automated negotiation is pointed as one of the mechanisms that may provide a solution to this kind of problems. In this article, a multi-issue bilateral bargaining model for Ambient Intelligence domains is presented where it is assumed that agents have computational bounded resources and do not know their opponents’ preferences. The main goal of this work is to provide negotiation models that obtain efficient agreements while maintaining the computational cost low. A niching genetic algorithm is used before the negotiation process to sample one’s own utility function (self-sampling). During the negotiation process, genetic operators are applied over the opponent’s and one’s own offers in order to sample new offers that are interesting for both parties. Results show that the proposed model is capable of outperforming similarity heuristics which only sample before the negotiation process and of obtaining similar results to similarity heuristics which have access to all of the possible offers.,Publisher Statement: NOTICE: this is the author’s version of a work that was accepted for publication in Information Sciences.

Next, the discrete wavelet transform (DWT) coefficients are utilized as features, which offer even a better recognition performance. A combination of these two features is found to demonstrate a high within class compactness and between class separation. A pre-processing scheme is incorporated prior to feature extraction to reduce the effect of different noises and artefacts. In the recognition phase, a linear discriminant based classifier is employed, where the two features are jointly utilized.

This paper presents 1-D CFD simulation using Ricardo WAVE of 30 % downsizing on a 2.0 litre naturally aspirated spark ignition engine to a 1.4 litre turbocharged gasoline direct injection variable valve timing engine. Performance improvement has been achieved by using turbocharging and variable valve technology. Turbocharging a spark ignition engine increases the intake temperature and pressure, causing the mixture to detonate. To prevent engine mixture detonation, direct injection has been used, which also allows an increase in the compression ratio. The downsized engine has been optimised for maximum volumetric efficiency, maximum brake mean effective pressure and knock elimination. Valve opening timing, their durations and lifts have been optimised to improve volumetric efficiency. Fuel-air ratio and start of injection timing have also been optimised to improve the maximum brake mean effective pressure.

Women were more likely to hear more than three sounds in their tinnitus, hear it in both ears, experience gradual onset of tinnitus, and hear it at lower pitches. Our findings are confirmed by the use of a measure derived from market basket analysis, that of lift. ","School of Computing, Electronics and Maths"

A voter is used in these implementations to determine a possibly correct result through the majority vote. The reliability of the voter circuit should be much higher than that of the other circuit elements; otherwise it will wipe out the gains of the redundancy scheme. Since almost all the circuit elements are fabricated with the same technology, the voter circuit itself needs to be fault-tolerant. In this paper, we present a novel fault-tolerant voter circuit design with a simple structure, so that it can easily be used for N-modular redundancy implementations as well as for systems with more than a single bit output.","School of Computing, Electronics and Maths"

Mobile learning poses a challenge to established instructional strategies with respect to delivering feedback and monitoring learner progress, particularly in informal and incidental learning occurring outside of formal structured learning environments. We argue that well-designed and managed feedback and progress indicators can offer guidance and a sense of structure to learners in the absence of a formal curriculum, accreditation or set outcomes. Furthermore, they can encourage casual users of mobile applications to move from fragmented learning episodes towards a more long term and reflective learning journey. In this paper we describe how we are developing feedback and progress indicators for the EU-funded MASELTOV project, which explores how smartphones can support language learning and social inclusion for recent immigrants to Europe. Presenting educational services and materials on mobile devices allows learning episodes to be incorporated into daily activities and schedules, to be accessed at times and in places that suit learners best. Feedback and progress indicators embedded into these services may motivate such an audience to reconceptualise fragmentary, ephemeral educational experiences into a more coherent, sustained learning journey. We describe how feedback and progress indicators have been used successfully in web-based and games-based learning, and our assessment of which types may best support incidental mobile learning and the challenges we face.

However, direct measurement of this parameter is impractical in fielded applications. The paper presents an empirical, multiple linear regression based approach for estimating body segment equivalent temperatures for car cabin occupants from different sensors within the car. Body part equivalent temperature at eight segments and cabin sensor data (air temperature, surface temperature, mean radiant temperature, humidity and solar load) was gathered in a variety of environmental and cabin conditions. 38 experimental hours of trials in a controlled environment and 26 experimental hours of realistic driving trials were used for training and evaluating the estimator's performance. The estimation errors were on average between 0.5°C and 1.9°C for different body parts for trials within a controlled environment, while for trials in realistic driving scenarios they ranged between 1°C and 2°C. This demonstrates that passenger body part equivalent temperature can be estimated using a multiple linear regression from environmental sensors and leads the way to comfort driven Heating, Ventilation and Air Conditioning control.","School of Computing, Electronics and Maths"

It is shown that the use of autocorrelation operation on a speech signal, which is band-limited to a particular formant zone, in comparison to one without any band limitation, can provide higher noise immunity, especially under severe noisy condition. In order to extract each formant, a modified higher order Yule-Walker method is employed on the resulting autocorrelation sequence. Within a band, the pole with the maximum energy is selected as the formant. The estimated formants are used as features along with conventional Mel frequency cepstral coefficients in a vowel recognition system, where the linear discriminant based classifier is utilized. Extensive experimentation is carried out on speech samples taken from the TIMIT standard speech database. It is found that the proposed algorithm provides superior formant estimation accuracy in comparison to that obtained by some of the state of the art methods even at a very low level of signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) for both male and female speakers. Moreover, formant estimates obtained by the proposed method can also provide better vowel recognition accuracy in the presence of significant background noise.","School of Computing, Electronics and Maths"

The main objective of the system is not only finding the right allocations for user’s need, but also minimizing energy consumption. However, the users of the system may have conflicting preferences over the rooms to be allocated for them. This paper pursues how the system can increase user satisfaction while achieving its goals. For that purpose, an adaptation of the mediated single text negotiation model is introduced.

Agent behaviour is the product of artificial intelligence systems working in tandem, however the sophistication of these systems is not a guarantee of achieving believable behaviour. Within locations based upon reality such as an urban environment, the perceived realism of agent behaviour becomes even harder to achieve. This paper presents the development of a crowd simulation that is based upon a real-life urban environment, which is then subjected to perceptual experimentation to identify features of behaviour which can be linked to perceived realism. This research is predicted to feedback into the development processes of inhabited cities, especially those attempting to simulate perceptually realistic agents as it will highlight features of behaviour that are important to implement. The perceptual experimentation methodologies presented can also be adapted and potentially utilised to test other types of crowd simulation, whether it be for the purposes of computer games or even urban planning and health and safety.","School of Computing, Electronics and Maths"

An adaptive security scheme is proposed, that involves the minimum energy needed to achieve a desired security level. The subsequent security approach is twofold. First, encryption strength is adjusted according to the severity of the requested service. This helps save energy, while preserving the encryption strength. Second, for battery-powered devices, data can be encrypted according to a specified threshold, or even based on the battery level itself. The reliability function, which is the backbone of the proposed adaptive security scheme, serves as a quality factor that describes all encryption parameters and their impact on energy consumption and therefore as a global indicator of the overall security with respect to the energy consumption.","School of Computing, Electronics and Maths"

Proper modeling of such systems frequently requires the construction of ensembles of digraphs with a given sequence of in- and out-degrees. As the number of simple labeled graphs with a given degree sequence is typically very large even for short sequences, sampling methods are needed for statistical studies. Currently, there are two main classes of methods that generate samples. One of the existing methods first generates a restricted class of graphs, then uses a Markov Chain Monte-Carlo algorithm based on edge swaps to generate other realizations. As the mixing time of this process is still unknown, the independence of the samples is not well controlled. The other class of methods is based on the Configuration Model that may lead to unacceptably many sample rejections due to self-loops and multiple edges. Here we present an algorithm that can directly construct all possible realizations of a given bi-degree sequence by simple digraphs. Our method is rejection free, guarantees the independence of the constructed samples, and provides their weight. The weights can then be used to compute statistical averages of network observables as if they were obtained from uniformly distributed sampling, or from any other chosen distribution.

The role of warning dissemination is a key part in the success of such large-scale evacuations and its inadequacy in certain cases has been a ‘primary contribution to deaths and injuries’ (Hayden et al., 2007). Along with technology-driven ‘official warning channels’ (e.g. sirens, mass media), the role of unofficial channel (e.g. neighbours, personal contacts, volunteer wardens) has proven to be significant in warning the public of the need to evacuate. Although post-evacuation studies identify the behaviours of evacuees as disseminators of the warning message, there has not been a detailed study that quantifies the effects of such behaviour on the warning message dissemination. This paper develops an Agent-Based Simulation (ABS) model of multiple agents (evacuee households) in a hypothetical community to investigate the impact of behaviour as an unofficial channel on the overall warning dissemination. Parameters studied include the percentage of people who warn their neighbours, the efficiency of different official warning channels, and delay time to warn neighbours. Even with a low proportion of people willing to warn their neighbour, the results showed considerable impact on the overall warning dissemination.","School of Computing, Electronics and Maths"

We choose interaction parameters as is done for a standard model, i.e., the Lennard-Jones fluid and we consider symmetric chains, i.e., the multiblock copolymer consists of an even number n of alternating chemically different A and B blocks of the same length N A = N B = N. We show how usual static properties of the individual blocks and the whole multiblock chain can reflect the phase behavior of such macromolecules. Also, how parameters, such as the number of blocks n can affect properties of the individual blocks, when chains are in a poor solvent for a certain range of n. A detailed discussion of the static properties of these symmetric multiblock copolymers is also given. Our results in combination with recent simulation results on the behavior of multiblock copolymer chains provide a complete picture for the behavior of these macromolecules under poor solvent conditions, at least for this most symmetrical case.

Performance of the stove with resistive and diode bridge loads are compared to evaluate how nonlinear loads affect thermo-acoustic performance. The detailed construction and design issue of the tested prototype is presented. The engine pressure and the temperature profile of the Hot heat exchanger (HHX), Ambient heat exchanger (AHX), water outlet (Twout) and water inlet (Twin) have been measured and analysed to see the variation of the peak pressure and onset temperature of oscillation. Several Experiments have been carried out using different length feed back pipe with different sizes tuning stub in order to match the engine frequency with the Alternator to achieve the high electrical output. Electrical load on the linear alternator was simulated with a load box that can present a resistive, diode bridge plus capacitor, or diode bridge plus lead acid battery. Variations of pressure and temperature of the engine as well as electrical power were measured. Since the ultimate goal is to supply the power to the 12 V lead acid battery and it is necessary to match the acoustic impedance with the battery rectifier circuit to achieve the maximum output power. This paper will show that the engine with the bridge rectifier load acted the same as a resistive load that absorbed the same power.

Therefore, several approximation and (meta) heuristic algorithms have been proposed which aim at finding good, but not necessarily optimal, solutions to the problem. In this paper, we propose a new algorithm based on the constructive beam search method. We have devised a novel heuristic, inspired by the probability theory, intended for domains where the input strings are assumed to be independent. Special data structures and dynamic programming methods are developed to reduce the time complexity of the algorithm. The proposed algorithm is compared with the state-of-the-art over several standard benchmarks including random and real biological sequences.

FFMSP belongs to the class of sequence consensus problems which have applications in molecular biology, amongst others. FFMSP is NP-hard. It does not admit a constant-ratio approximation either, unless P=NP. In the last few years, heuristic and metaheuristic algorithms have been proposed for the problem, which use local search and require a heuristic, also called an evaluation function, to evaluate candidate solutions during local search. The heuristic function used, for this purpose, in these algorithms is the problem’s objective function. However, since many candidate solutions can be of the same objective value, the resulting search landscape includes many points which correspond to local maxima. In this paper, we devise a new heuristic function to evaluate candidate solutions. We then incorporate the proposed heuristic function within a Greedy Randomized Adaptive Search Procedure (GRASP), a metaheuristic originally proposed for the problem by Festa. The resulting algorithm outperforms state-of-the-art with respect to solution quality, in some cases by orders of magnitude, on both random and real data in our experiments.

Given the importance that is associated with emotions in humans, it is unlikely that robots will be accepted as anything more that machines if they do not express and recognise emotions. In this paper, we describe the performance of an unsupervised approach to emotion recognition that achieves similar performance to current supervised intelligent approaches. Performance, however, reduces when the system is tested using samples from a male volunteer not in the training set using a low cost microphone. Through the use of an unsupervised neural approach, it is possible to go beyond the basic binary classification of emotions to consider the similarity between emotions and whether speech can express multiple emotions at the same time","School of Computing, Electronics and Maths"

Linking Photographic Records across Collections Using Fuzzy Logic,"This paper describes a novel approach to interrogating different online collections to identify potential matches between them, using fuzzy logic-based data-mining algorithms. Potentially, information about objects from one collection could be used to enrich records in another where there are overlaps. But although there is a considerable amount of bibliographic and other kinds of data on the Web that share similar information, a standardized way of structuring such data in a way that makes it easy to identify significant relationships does not yet exist. In the case of historical photographs, the challenge is further exacerbated by the enormous range of subjects depicted, and the fact that surviving records are not always complete, accurate, or consistent and the amount of text available per record is very small. Fuzzy-matching algorithms combined with semantic similarity techniques offer a way of finding potential matches between such items when standard ontology and corpus-based approaches are inadequate, in this case helping researchers for the first time match photographs held in different archives to historical exhibition catalogue records.","School of Computing, Electronics and Maths"

The numerical data we obtain and the relevant finite-size scaling analysis provide clear answers regarding the universality aspects of both models. In particular, for the random-bond case of the 2d Ising model the theoretically predicted strong universality’s hypothesis is verified, whereas for the second-order regime of the Blume-Capel model, the expected d = 3 Ising universality is verified. Our study is facilitated by the combined use of the Wang-Landau algorithm and the critical energy subspace scheme, indicating that the proposed scheme is able to provide accurate results on the critical behavior of complex spin systems.","School of Computing, Electronics and Maths"

Creating effective interventions, which stimulate peer involvement, remains a demanding task and finding a solution that is not only engaging but also pedagogically sound is vital. A case thus exists for exploring how game technology might facilitate more feasible solutions. This paper presents the development approach of a digital game: PR:EPARe (Positive Relationships: Eliminating Coercion and Pressure in Adolescent Relationships), designed by a cross-disciplinary team of UK researchers from Coventry University's Studies in Adolescent Sexual Health (SASH) research group and the Serious Games Institute (SGI). Psychological targets for game content were identified through Intervention Mapping (IM) and the game design process was based on the Four-Dimensional Framework of Learning (4DF) emphasizing the context of deployment, learner profiling and the pedagogical perspective that influence the mode of representation of the learning content. Early efficacy testing of the game solution was validated through a cluster-randomized controlled trial in local schools (n = 505) indicated some positive outcomes in favour of the game-based approach, based on self-reported measures of psycho-social preparedness for avoiding coercion (F [3, 501] = 15.306, p <.001, η2p [please see printed abstract for correct symbol] = 0.084). Analysis of observation data suggests that blending this interactive game-based approach with traditional classroom delivery encouraged the teachers and students to engage in communal discussions and debriefing during and after game play. Together, the results demonstrated real benefits for pedagogy-driven game-based approaches to support the delivery of RSE within a classroom setting.",

It is shown analytically and numerically that the new model has noticeable advantages over popular models in image processing tasks. For the numerical minimization of the new objective, subspace correction methods are introduced which guarantee the convergence and monotone decay of the associated energy along the iterates. Moreover, an estimate of the distance between the outcome of the subspace correction method and the global minimizer of the nonsmooth objective is derived. This estimate and numerical experiments for image denoising, inpainting, and deblurring indicate that in practice the proposed subspace correction methods indeed approach the global solution of the underlying minimization problem.","School of Computing, Electronics and Maths"

Yu",Socio-semantic integration of educational resources - the case of the mEducator project,"Research in technology-enhanced learning (TEL) throughout the last decade has largely focused on sharing and reusing educational resources and data. This effort has led to a fragmented landscape of competing metadata schemas, such as IEEE LOM or ADL SCORM, and interface mechanisms, such as OAI-PMH, SQI and REST-ful services in general. More recently, semantic technologies were taken into account to improve interoperability. However, so far Web-scale integration of resources is not facilitated, mainly due to the lack of take-up of shared principles, datasets and schemas. On the other hand, the Linked Data approach has emerged as the de facto standard for sharing data on the Web and is fundamentally based on established W3C standards. This paper presents results of the European Commission-funded project mEducator, which exploits Linked Data principles for (1) semantic integration and (2) social interconnecting of educational data, resources and actors. We describe a general approach to exploit the wealth of already existing educational data on the Web by allowing its exposure as Linked Data and by taking into account automated enrichment and interlinking techniques to provide a rich and well-interlinked graph for the educational domain. Additionally, the paper presents an evaluation of our work with respect to a set of socio-semantic dimensions. Experimental results demonstrate improved interoperability and retrievability of the resulting resource descriptions as part of an interlinked resource graph.",

As the number of educational games available increases, serious games are starting to face a similar dilemma to other types of educational resources: how can educators or parents easily find the most relevant games and share their experiences from using these games? To this end, the EduGameLab project has developed a tool for sharing experiences about educational games among educators and parents. The development of this tool was based on a metadata schema for formally describing serious games and experiences with these games. In this paper we report on the development of this tool, revisit and refine the metadata schema based on our experiences and evaluate the usability and usefulness of the tool based on feedback gathered at practical workshops with educators.

Reduction of new HIV infections by implementing a comprehensive national HIV prevention programme at a sufficient scale to have real impact remains a priority. In this paper, a deterministic HIV/AIDS model that incorporates condom use, screening through HIV counseling and testing (HCT), regular testing and treatment as control strategies is proposed with the objective of quantifying the effectiveness of HCT in preventing new infections and predicting the long-term dynamics of the epidemic. It is found that a backward bifurcation occurs if the rate of screening is below a certain threshold, suggesting that the classical requirement for the basic reproduction number to be below unity though necessary, is not sufficient for disease control in this case. The global stabilities of the equilibria under certain conditions are determined in terms of the model reproduction number R(0). Numerical simulations are performed and the model is fitted to data on HIV prevalence in South Africa. The effects of changes in some key epidemiological parameters are investigated. Projections are made to predict the long-term dynamics of the disease. The epidemiological implications of such projections on public health planning and management are discussed.","School of Computing, Electronics and Maths"

By arranging the resonator in a planar array, it is possible to use the structure as a sensing device for organic and inorganic compounds. The sensor is designed to detect the presence of a biological compound by permittivity or absorption measurements. The presence of the biological matter modifies the effective permittivity and, thus, the resonant frequency significantly varies. In addition, biological compounds typically exhibit absorption characteristics that depend on the corresponding molecular structure. Therefore, it is necessary to illuminate the material selectively. We show that by employing the ""selective"" properties of the metamaterial resonator proposed, it is possible to enhance the sensing performances. The proposed design is suitable to sense the presence of healthy and malignant tissues, with possible applications in food and medical diagnostics.

Their non--linear characteristics and the property of the hysteresis are posing several difficulties in simulating these pneumatic actuators and to obtain a comprehension of the PMA's physical movement. In this article a novel detailed modeling, based on hardware in the loop simulation studies, capable to describe the dynamic characteristic of the PMA and a detailed simulation environment for studying the cascade movement of PMAs will be presented.","School of Computing, Electronics and Maths"

A SAS is appointments based and is normally provided in addition to drop-in support offered via a mathematics support centre. Typically it offers statistics advice in relation to aspects of study design, questionnaire design, data analysis, use of statistics software, and the interpretation and reporting of results. However, not all UK HE institutions currently offer this type of SAS, possibly due to a lack of suitably experienced personnel or financial resources. In response to this, a National HE STEM Programme pilot project operated an online SAS shared between several HE institutions. The objectives of the project were to identify the practical and pedagogical issues associated with sharing an online SAS resource, and to elicit the opinions of students using the service in order to understand their expectations and experience of using this type of online support.","School of Computing, Electronics and Maths"

Scenarios involving negotiation teams require coordination among party members in order to reach a good agreement for all of the party members. An intra-team strategy defines what decisions are taken by the negotiation team and when and how these decisions are taken. Thus, they are tightly linked with the results obtained by the team in a negotiation process. Environmental conditions affect the performance of the different intra-team strategies in different ways. Thus, team members need to analyze their environment in order to select the most appropriate strategy according to the current conditions. In this paper, we analyze how environmental conditions affect different intra-team strategies in order to provide teams with the knowledge necessary to select the proper intra-team strategy.","School of Computing, Electronics and Maths"

Much of the published work in this context has typically focused on the use of generalized linear models, which are non-dynamic in the sense that the parameters in the model, which often represent the underlying abilities of each team, are assumed to remain constant over time. Dynamic generalized linear models (DGLMs) on the other hand allow the abilities of each team to vary over time. This paper illustrates the application of a DGLM in the context of football match outcome prediction and describes improvements on similar work previously presented by the author, in relation to the estimation of a parameter in the model, referred to as the evolution variance, which is crucial in terms of optimizing the predictive performance of these types of models. Match results data from the Scottish Premier League from 2003/2004 to 2005/2006 are used to show that the DGLM approach provides improved predictive probabilities of future match outcomes compared to the non-dynamic form of the model. DGLMs are also Bayesian in terms of their structure and so a Bayesian approach to parameter estimation is required. This paper therefore illustrates a practical implementation of the DGLM model that can easily be deployed using the freely available software WinBUGS.","School of Computing, Electronics and Maths"

Characteristics of the return flow (such as varying quality of returned products, uncertainty in a volume of returned products, etc) and the complexity of integrating reverse and forward network flows have led to complex optimization problems. In this paper, an inventory control model for a reverse logistics network with distinguishable quality levels of returned products, two alternative recovery routes including repair and remanufacturing routes and a disposal route, in addition to the traditional production route, is proposed. A genetic-fuzzy framework is developed to optimize the network in a multi objective optimization setting with respect to three objectives; cost, environmental emission and customer service level. A multi objective genetic algorithm (MOGA) is developed to design fuzzy controllers to generate the Pareto optimal solutions.

In this approach, wireless sensor nodes are permanently deployed within the distribution system, providing continuous, on-line hydraulic data that can be assimilated into hydraulic models. In addition, temporary nodes are deployed for short periods (one week) around the distribution network. A Virtual Sensor is implemented using a data imputation technique called Gaussian Process Regression, which combines the historical data collected by the temporary node with correlated data from a subset of permanent sensor nodes. Use of spatially-correlated data accounts for new trends in the data that do not appear in the historical data collected by the temporary node. An increase in the number of sensors (a combination of real and virtual) is important for reducing the ill-conditioned state of the hydraulic model calibration procedure. The technique is demonstrated as a proof-of-concept using data collected from the WaterWiSe@SG testbed in Singapore, and is shown to predict pressure data trends with an accuracy of 0.76 PSI RMSE after a six-week test.","School of Computing, Electronics and Maths"

Traditionally, this problem was tackled by sequentially comparing the given query against all the time series in the database, and returning all the time series that are within a predetermined threshold of that query. But the large size and the high dimensionality of time series databases that are in use nowadays make that scenario inefficient. There are many representation techniques that aim at reducing the dimensionality of time series so that the search can be handled faster at a lower-dimensional space level. The symbolic aggregate approximation (SAX) is one of the most competitive methods in the literature. In this paper we present a new method that improves the performance of SAX by adding to it another exclusion condition that increases the exclusion power. This method is based on using two representations of the time series: one of SAX and the other is based on an optimal approximation of the time series. Pre-computed distances are calculated and stored offline to be used online to exclude a wide range of the search space using two exclusion conditions. We conduct experiments which show that the new method is faster than SAX.","School of Computing, Electronics and Maths"

Qualitative analysis of the model including positivity and boundedness is performed. In addition to the disease free equilibrium, we show that there exists a boundary equilibrium corresponding to each species. The isolation reproductive number of each species is computed as well as the reproductive number of the full model. Conditions for global stability of the disease free equilibrium as well as local stability of the boundary equilibria are derived. The model has an interior equilibrium which exists if at least one of the isolation reproductive numbers is greater than unity. Among the interesting dynamical behaviours of the model, the phenomenon of backward bifurcation where a stable boundary equilibrium coexists with a stable interior equilibrium, for a certain range of the associated invasion reproductive number less than unity is observed. Results from analysis of the model show that, when cross-immunity between the two species is weak, there is a high probability of coexistence of the two species and when cross-immunity is strong, competitive exclusion is high. Further, an increase in the reproductive number of species i increases the stability of its boundary equilibrium and its ability to invade an equilibrium of species j.

We also carried out logistic regression to assess the association between illicit drug use and explanatory variables. For the purpose of this study, illicit drug use was defined as marijuana or glue use.,RESULTS: A total of 1984 adolescents participated in the study. Most of the sample were females (50.7%), 15-year- olds (30.3%), nonsmokers and non-alcohol drinkers. Nine percent of the subjects (13.4% males and 4.9% females) reported having ever used marijuana or glue. Males were more likely to have used marijuana or glue than females (OR=2.70; 95% CI [1.47, 4.96]). Marijuana or glue use was positively associated with cigarette smoking (OR=11.17; 95% CI [4.29, 29.08]), alcohol drinking (OR=7.00; 95% CI [3.39, 14.47]) and sexual intercourse (OR=5.17; 95% CI [2.59, 10.29]).

Here, we show that non-reversible Markov chains can be set up that generate correct stationary distributions, but reduce or eliminate the diffusive motion in phase space typical of the usual Monte Carlo dynamics. Our approach is based on splitting the dynamics into a set of replicas with each replica representing a biased movement in reaction-coordinate space. This introduction of an additional bias in a given replica is compensated for by choosing an appropriate dynamics on the other replicas such as to ensure the validity of global balance. First, we apply this method to a mean-field Ising model, splitting the system into two replicas: one trying to increase magnetization and the other trying to decrease it. For this simple test system, our results show that the altered dynamics is able to reduce the dynamical critical exponent. Generalizations of this scheme to simulations of the Ising model in two dimensions are discussed.","School of Computing, Electronics and Maths"

McGinnity, Liam Maguire, Liam McDaid, Ammar Belatreche",Neuro-inspired speech recognition based on reservoir computing,"This chapter investigates the potential of recurrent spiking neurons for classification,problems. It presents a hybrid approach based on the paradigm of Reservoir Computing. The,practical applications based on recurrent spiking neurons are limited due to the lack of,learning algorithms. Most of the previous work in the literature has focused on feed forward,networks because computation in these networks is comparatively easy to analyse. The,details of such networks have been reported in detail in (Haykin, 1999) (Pavlidis et al., 2005),(Bohte et al., 2000). Recently, a strategy proposed by Maass (Maass et al., 2002) and Jaeger,(Jaeger, 2001) offers to overcome the burden of recurrent neural networks training. In this,paradigm, instead of training the whole recurrent network only the output layer (known as,readout neuron) is trained.,This chapter investigates the potential of recurrent spiking neurons as the basic building,blocks for the liquid or so called reservoir. These recurrent neural networks are termed as,microcircuits which are viewed as basic computational units in cortical computation (Maass,et al., 2002). These microcircuits are connected as columns which are linked with other,neighboring columns in cortical areas. These columns read out information from each other,and serve both as reservoir and readout. The reservoir is modeled as a dynamical system,perturbed by the input stream where only readouts are trained to extract information from,the reservoir. The basic motivation behind investigating recurrent neurons is their potential,to memorise relevant events over short periods of time (Maass et al., 2002). The use of,feedback enables recurrent networks to acquire state representation which makes them,suitable for temporal based applications such as speech recognition. It is challenging to,solve such problems with recurrent networks due to the burden of training. The paradigm,of reservoir computing also referred to as liquid computing relaxes the burden of training,because only an output layer is trained instead of training the whole network. The work,presented in this chapter analyses the theoretical framework of Reservoir Computing and,demonstrates results in terms of classification accuracy through the application of speech,recognition. The design space for this paradigm is split into three domains; front end,,reservoir, and back end. This work contributes to the identification of suitable front and,back end processing techniques along with stable reservoir dynamics, which provides a,reliable framework for classification related problems.,The work presented in this chapter suggests a simple and efficient biologically plausible,approach based on a hybrid implementation of recurrent spiking neurons and classical feed forward networks for an application of isolated digit recognition. The structure of this,chapter is as follows: section 2 elaborates the motivation, related work, theoretical review,and description of the paradigm of reservoir computing. Section 3 contains details about the,experimental setup and investigates front-end pre-processing techniques and reservoir,dynamics. A baseline feed forward classifier is described in section 4 and results are,presented. Results based on reservoir recognition are presented in section 5.

Robustness of inferences to misspecification of the prior density would at least ensure that a selected candidate model would give similar predictions of future data points given somewhat different priors and a given large training data set. In this paper we derive new explicit total variation bounds on the calculated posterior density as the function of the closeness of the genuine prior to the approximating one used and certain summary statistics of the calculated posterior density. We show that the approximating posterior density often converges to the genuine one as the number of sample point increases and our bounds allow us to identify when the posterior approximation might not. To prove our general results we needed to develop a new family of distance measures called local DeRobertis distances. These provide coarse non-parametric neighbourhoods and allowed us to derive elegant explicit posterior bounds in total variation. The bounds can be routinely calculated for BNs even when the sample has systematically missing observations and no conjugate analyses are possible.,"School of Computing, Electronics and Maths"

When the two temperatures are equal the system becomes the equilibrium XY model with the continuous Kosterlitz-Thouless (KT) vortex-antivortex unbinding phase transition. When the two temperatures are unequal the system is driven by an energy flow through the system from the higher temperature heat-bath to the lower temperature one and reaches a far-from-equilibrium steady state. We show that the nonequilibrium phase diagram contains three phases: A homogenous disordered phase and two phases with long range, spin-wave order. Two critical lines, representing continuous phase transitions from a homogenous disordered phase to two phases of long range order, meet at the equilibrium the KT point. The shape of the nonequilibrium critical lines as they approach the KT point is described by a crossover exponent of phi = 2.52±0.05. Finally, we suggest that the transition between the two phases with long-range order is first-order, making the KT-point where all three phases meet a bicritical point.","School of Computing, Electronics and Maths"

When the system is placed in a sufficiently strong external field, however, the size of clusters of like spins diverges. There is evidence that this percolation transition is in the universality class of standard site percolation. It has been claimed that, for small disorder, a similar percolation phenomenon also occurs in zero external field. Using exact algorithms, we study ground states of large samples and find little evidence for a transition at zero external field. Nevertheless, for sufficiently small random-field strengths, there is an extended region of the phase diagram, where finite samples are indistinguishable from a critical percolating system. In this regime we examine ground-state domain walls, finding strong evidence that they are conformally invariant and satisfy Schramm–Loewner evolution (SLEκ) with parameter κ=6. These results add support to the hope that at least some aspects of systems with quenched disorder might be ultimately studied with the techniques of SLE and conformal field theory.","School of Computing, Electronics and Maths"

Fytas,Multicritical points and crossover mediating the strong violation of universality: Wang-Landau determinations in the random-bond d=2 Blume-Capel model,"The effects of bond randomness on the phase diagram and critical behavior of the square lattice ferromagnetic Blume-Capel model are discussed. The system is studied in both the pure and disordered versions by the same efficient two-stage Wang-Landau method for many values of the crystal field, restricted here in the second-order phase-transition regime of the pure model. For the random-bond version several disorder strengths are considered. We present phase diagram points of both pure and random versions and for a particular disorder strength we locate the emergence of the enhancement of ferromagnetic order observed in an earlier study in the ex-first-order regime. The critical properties of the pure model are contrasted and compared to those of the random model. Accepting, for the weak random version, the assumption of the double-logarithmic scenario for the specific heat we attempt to estimate the range of universality between the pure and random-bond models. The behavior of the strong disorder regime is also discussed and a rather complex and yet not fully understood behavior is observed. It is pointed out that this complexity is related to the ground-state structure of the random-bond version.","School of Computing, Electronics and Maths"

We extend the model to focus on the effects of condom use as a single strategy approach in HIV prevention in the absence of any other intervention strategies. Initially, we model the use of male condoms, followed by incorporating the use of both the female and male condoms. The model includes two primary factors in condom use to control HIV which are condom efficacy and compliance. Reproductive numbers for these models are computed and compared to assess the effectiveness of male and female condom use in a community. We also extend the basic model to consider the effects of antiretroviral therapy as a single strategy. The results from the study show that condoms can reduce the number of secondary infectives and thus can slow the development of the HIV/AIDS epidemic. Further, we note from the study that treatment of AIDS patients may enlarge the epidemic when the treatment drugs are not 100% effective and when treated AIDS patients indulge in risky sexual behaviour. Thus, the treatment with amelioration of AIDS patients should be accompanied with intense public health educational programs, which are capable of changing the attitude of treated AIDS patients towards safe sex. It is also shown from the study that the use of condoms in settings with the treatment may help in reducing the number of secondary infections thus slowing the epidemic.","School of Computing, Electronics and Maths"

While this is true in terms of its simplicity and universal applicability, the resulting approach suffers from the presence of temporal correlations of successive samples naturally implied by the Markov chain underlying the importance-sampling simulation. In many situations, these autocorrelations are moderate and can be easily accounted for by an appropriately adapted analysis of simulation data. They turn out to be a major hurdle, however, in the vicinity of phase transitions or for systems with complex free-energy landscapes. The critical slowing down close to continuous transitions is most efficiently reduced by the application of cluster algorithms, where they are available. For first-order transitions and disordered systems, on the other hand, macroscopic energy barriers need to be overcome to prevent dynamic ergodicity breaking. In this situation, generalized-ensemble techniques such as the multicanonical simulation method can effect impressive speedups, allowing to sample the full free-energy landscape. The Potts model features continuous as well as first-order phase transitions and is thus a prototypic example for studying phase transitions and new algorithmic approaches. I discuss the possibilities of bringing together cluster and generalized-ensemble methods to combine the benefits of both techniques. The resulting algorithm allows for the efficient estimation of the random-cluster partition function encoding the information of all Potts models, even with a non-integer number of states, for all temperatures in a single simulation run per system size.

The high dimensionality and large volume of time series databases make sequential scanning inefficient to tackle this problem. There are many representation techniques that aim at reducing the dimensionality of time series so that the search can be handled faster at a lower dimensional space level. Symbolic representation is one of the promising techniques, since symbolic representation methods try to benefit from the wealth of search algorithms used in bioinformatics and text mining communities. The symbolic aggregate approximation (SAX) is one of the most competitive methods in the literature. SAX utilizes a similarity measure that is easy to compute because it is based on pre-computed distances obtained from lookup tables. In this paper we present a new similarity measure that is almost as easy to compute as the original similarity measure, but it is tighter because it uses updated lookup tables. In addition, the new similarity measure is more intuitive than the original one. We conduct several experiments which show that the new similarity measure gives better results than the original one.","School of Computing, Electronics and Maths"

We have previously measured the scaling behavior of the central peak by scattering from a near-surface region of a V2H crystal, which has a first-order transition in the bulk. As the temperature is lowered toward the critical temperature, a crossover in critical behavior is seen, with the temperature range nearest to the critical point being characterized by mean field exponents. Near the transition, a small two-phase coexistence region is observed. The values of transition and crossover temperatures decay with depth. An explanation of these experimental results is here proposed by means of a theory in which edge dislocations in the near-surface region occur in walls oriented in the two directions normal to the surface. The strain caused by the dislocation lines causes the ordering in the crystal to occur as growth of roughly cylindrically shaped regions. After the regions have reached a certain size, the crossover in the critical behavior occurs, and mean field behavior prevails. At a still lower temperature, the rest of the material between the cylindrical regions orders via a weak first-order transition.","School of Computing, Electronics and Maths"

Existing graph sampling methods are either link-swap based (Markov-Chain Monte Carlo algorithms) or stub-matching based (the Configuration Model). Both types are ill-controlled, with typically unknown mixing times for link-swap methods and uncontrolled rejections for the Configuration Model. Here we propose an efficient, polynomial time algorithm that generates statistically independent graph samples with a given, arbitrary, degree sequence. The algorithm provides a weight associated with each sample, allowing the observable to be measured either uniformly over the graph ensemble, or, alternatively, with a desired distribution. Unlike other algorithms, this method always produces a sample, without back-tracking or rejections. Using a central limit theorem-based reasoning, we argue, that for large N, and for degree sequences admitting many realizations, the sample weights are expected to have a lognormal distribution. As examples, we apply our algorithm to generate networks with degree sequences drawn from power-law distributions and from binomial distributions.","School of Computing, Electronics and Maths"

Comparable exponents have been reported in a variety of physical systems. These systems undergo a range of different types of phase transitions, including structural transitions, exciton percolation, and magnetic ordering. In particular, similar exponents have been found to describe the development of magnetic order at the onset of the pseudogap transition in high-temperature superconductors. Their common universal critical exponents suggest that the essential physics of the transition in all of these physical systems is the same as in our model.

Phase transition temperatures, thermal and magnetic critical exponents are determined for lattice sizes in the range L=20–100 via a sophisticated two-stage numerical strategy of entropic sampling in dominant energy subspaces, using mainly the Wang-Landau algorithm. The second-order phase transition, emerging under random bonds from the second-order regime of the pure model, has the same values of critical exponents as the two-dimensional Ising universality class, with the effect of the bond disorder on the specific heat being well described by double-logarithmic corrections, our findings thus supporting the marginal irrelevance of quenched bond randomness. On the other hand, the second-order transition, emerging under bond randomness from the first-order regime of the pure model, has a distinctive universality class with ν=1.30(6) and β∕ν=0.128(5). These results amount to a strong violation of universality principle of critical phenomena, since these two second-order transitions, with different sets of critical exponents, are between the same ferromagnetic and paramagnetic phases. Furthermore, the latter of these two sets of results supports an extensive but weak universality, since it has the same magnetic critical exponent (but a different thermal critical exponent) as a wide variety of two-dimensional systems with and without quenched disorder. In the conversion by bond randomness of the first-order transition of the pure system to second order, we detect, by introducing and evaluating connectivity spin densities, a microsegregation that also explains the increase we find in the phase transition temperature under bond randomness.","School of Computing, Electronics and Maths"

The TB-only model is shown to exhibit backward bifurcation when its corresponding reproduction number is less than unity. On the other hand, the HIV/AIDS-only model has a globally asymptotically stable disease-free equilibrium when its corresponding reproduction number is less than unity. We proceed to analyze the full HIV-TB coinfection model and extend the model to incorporate antiretroviral therapy for the AIDS cases and treatment of active and latent forms of TB. The thresholds and equilibria quantities for the models are determined and stabilities analyzed.

This work proposes to use body sensor networks (BSNs) to increase the safety of operatives in such missions through detailed physiological monitoring, fusion of health information, and remote alerts. Previous trials conducted by the authors have shown no correlation between the suit wearer's temperature at any single skin site and their core temperature, nor between single-point temperature variations and subjective thermal sensation. This paper reports on the development of a wearable, wireless, networked sensing system suitable for integration within the suit and deployment in manned missions. A sensor fusion and modeling approach is proposed that estimates the overall thermal sensation of the suit wearer, in real time, based on the multipoint temperature data. Zhang's thermal sensation model was used in this work. Modeling is performed locally to enable cooling system actuation, provide local feedback, and accommodate application specific constraints. Experimentation with the prototype confirms the importance of multisite skin measurement, timely cooling actuation, and monitoring the operative's thermal state. Evaluation of Zhang's model highlights the need for a bespoke model to account for suit and mission specific factors. The deployed BSN has been evaluated through experimental trials using a number of subjects in mission-like conditions and has been shown to be appropriate for the target application.","School of Computing, Electronics and Maths"

As it turns out, especially the tails of the distributions are not well described by the Poissonian or binomial model resulting from the assumption of uncorrelated random events. Instead, a good effective description of the data is provided by less basic distributions such as the negative binomial one or the probability densities of extreme value statistics. To understand this behavior from a microscopical point of view, however, no waiting time problem or extremal process need be invoked. Instead, modifying the Bernoulli random process underlying the Poissonian model to include a simple component of self-affirmation seems to describe the data surprisingly well and allows to understand the observed deviation from Gaussian statistics. The phenomenological distributions used before can be understood as special cases within this framework. We analyzed historical football score data from many leagues in Europe as well as from international tournaments, including data from all past tournaments of the “FIFA World Cup” series, and found the proposed models to be applicable rather universally. In particular, here we analyze the results of the German women's premier football league and consider the two separate German men's premier leagues in the East and West during the cold war times as well as the unified league after 1990 to see how scoring in football and the component of self-affirmation depend on cultural and political circumstances.

Such parameters include the unpredictabilities of playing the ball, the players' shape of the day or environmental conditions such as the weather and the behavior of the audience. Under such circumstances, it appears worthwhile to analyze football score data with the toolbox of mathematical statistics in order to separate deterministic from stochastic effects and see what impact the cooperative and social nature of the ""agents"" of the system has on the resulting stochastic observables. Considering the probability distributions of scored goals for the home and away teams, it turns out that especially the tails of the distributions are not well described by the Poissonian or binomial model resulting from the assumption of uncorrelated random events. On the contrary, some more specific probability densities such as those discussed in the context of extreme-value statistics or the so-called negative binomial distribution fit these data rather well. There seemed to be no good argument to date, however, why the simplest Poissonian model fails and, instead, the latter distributions should be observed. To fill this gap, we introduced a number of microscopic models for the scoring behavior, resulting in a Bernoulli random process with a simple component of self-affirmation. These models allow us to represent the observed probability distributions surprisingly well, and the phenomenological distributions used earlier can be understood as special cases within this framework. We analyzed historical football score data from many leagues in Europe as well as from international tournaments, including data from all past tournaments of the ""FIFA World Cup"" series, and found the proposed models to be applicable in all cases. To complete the picture, we conducted a field study with visitors of a science showcase to collect additional data from matches of tabletop football. As it turns out, also the latter data are represented well with our feedback models, underscoring their apparently rather universal applicability.","School of Computing, Electronics and Maths"

Faced with the common problems of spatially irregular sensor distribution and intermittent sensor measurement availability, key to fulfilling the monitoring aim is filling in the spatiotemporal gaps in the data. While wireless sensor networks (WSNs) technology, combined with microelectromechanical systems availability potentially offer sensing solutions for a variety of application domains, in the context of monitoring applications a conceptual shift is needed from currently available, point-measurement-based ldquosense-and-sendrdquo systems toward the provision of phenomena field representations, in real time, enabling effective visualization of the spatiotemporal patterns. This paper argues the case for a generic, rapid prototyping framework for end-to-end sensing systems that support the approach of providing field representations for visualization. A formal approach to framework development was taken, ensuring that resulting instrumentation systems are well specified. Both the framework development and its evaluation are linked to the full cycle of requirements setting, design, and deployment of a prototype instrumentation system for aerospace applications-specifically, health monitoring of a gas turbine engine. The field monitoring application prototyping (FieldMAP) framework supports multimodal sensing, provides a number of opportunities for data processing and information extraction, caters for monitoring of the instrumentation health, offers a modular field-mapping design component and allows for real-time phenomena visualization, data and information logging, and postanalysis. Experience with the FieldMAP has shown that sophisticated and robust prototypes can be developed in a short period of time.

We find that a sufficiently fast spinning suppresses and stabilizes the internal flow in the droplet. However, there is a narrow range of rotation rates corresponding to an Ekman number of E ≈ 10,, where the spinning can destabilize the internal flow.

In principle, the nature of an occurring spin-glass phase in such systems might be inferred from an analysis of the zero-temperature properties. Unfortunately, with few exceptions, the problem of finding ground-state configurations is a nonpolynomial problem computationally, such that efficient approximation algorithms are called for. Here, we employ the recently developed genetic embedded matching (GEM) heuristic to investigate the nature of the zero-temperature phase of the bimodal XY spin glass in two dimensions. We analyze bulk properties such as the asymptotic ground-state energy and the phase diagram of disorder strength vs disorder concentration. For the case of a symmetric distribution of ferromagnetic and antiferromagnetic bonds, we find that the ground state of the model is unique up to a global O(2) rotation of the spins. In particular, there are no extensive degeneracies in this model. The main focus of this work is on an investigation of the excitation spectrum as probed by changing the boundary conditions. Using appropriate finite-size scaling techniques, we consistently determine the stiffness of spin and chiral domain walls and the corresponding fractal dimensions. Most noteworthy, we find that the spin and chiral channels are characterized by two distinct stiffness exponents and, consequently, the system displays spin-chirality decoupling at large length scales. Results for the overlap distribution do not support the possibility of a multitude of thermodynamic pure states.","School of Computing, Electronics and Maths"

This approach has reoriented engine manufacturers from selling spare parts to trying to maximise each engine’s longevity. This reorientation has introduced a new emphasis on sensing and monitoring. An example is the temperature sensors harness developed by Vibro Meter UK, a wholly owned subsidiary of Meggit Plc. Their thermocouple probes are able to withstand the high temperatures found within the gas stream. In principle, the large number of thermocouple sensors mounted within the engine could provide detailed thermal maps and thus provide for accurate diagnosis of potential problems before they occur. A difficulty, however, is that sending all the individual sensor data back to the control unit would require a large amount of heavy duty cabling, thus significantly increasing the weight of the engine. To avoid this, sensor values are averaged, and only a single cable is used.
Even a single cable may be more than is necessary, however. By making use of wireless technology, low-power electronics, and advanced visualisation techniques researchers at Coventry University’s Cogent Computing Applied Research Centre (CCARC), are developing a system to wirelessly connect the high temperature thermocouples and perhaps other sensors on the gas turbine engine. Furthermore, they are looking at developing visualisation tools to ensure that the much more detailed gathered data can be easily interpreted. It is hoped that the development of such a wireless sensing system will lead to several important benefits: it will reduce the weight of the engine; it will allow a detailed map of temperatures within the gas flow of the engine to be obtained; it will allow sensor faults to be detected more readily.","School of Computing, Electronics and Maths"

We consider the case R = Jnn/Jnnn = 1 for which the competitive nature of interactions produces a sublattice ordering known as superantiferromagnetism and the pure system undergoes a second-order transition with a positive specific heat exponent α. For a particular disorder strength we study the effects of bond randomness and we find that, while the critical exponents of the correlation length ν, magnetization β, and magnetic susceptibility γ increase as compared to the pure model, the ratios β/ν and γ/ν remain unchanged. Thus, the disordered system obeys weak universality and hyperscaling similarly to other two-dimensional disordered systems. However, the specific heat exhibits an unusually strong saturating behavior which distinguishes the present case of competing interactions from other two-dimensional random bond systems studied previously.","School of Computing, Electronics and Maths"

The model assumes that latently infected individuals develop active disease as a result of endogenous re-activation, exogenous re-infection and disease relapse, though a small fraction is assumed to develop active disease soon after infection. We start by formulating and analyzing a TB model without any intervention strategy that we extend to incorporate chemoprophylaxis and treatment of infectives. The epidemic thresholds known as reproduction numbers and equilibria for the models are determined, and stabilities analyzed. The reproduction numbers for the models are compared to assess the possible community benefits achieved by treatment of infectives, chemoprophylaxis and a holistic approach of these intervention strategies. The study shows that treatment of infectives is more effective in the first years of implementation (approximately 10 years) as treatment results in clearing active TB immediately and there after chemoprophylaxis will do better in controlling the number of infectives due to reduced progression to active TB.","School of Computing, Electronics and Maths"

Several research groups world wide have engaged with the development of low-power wireless body sensor networks that are capable of providing real-time posture tracking for a variety of applications, such as dance and sports. The work reported here is concerned with the development of a wireless body sensor network that, as opposed to posture tracking, can: a) provide the identification and classification of eight human postures (standing, kneeling, sitting, crawling, walking, laying down on front and back, and laying on one side) in real-time and b) is able to relate this information wirelessly to a remote monitoring point. Posture information is an essential part of monitoring operatives in safety critical missions. The work sits within a larger project aiming to increase general safety of operatives in bomb disposal missions.
The goal of the posture body sensor network developed here is to identify the eight named postures using data from nine accelerometers placed at various sites on the human body.

The random bond version of the superantiferromagnetic (SAF) square model with nearest- and next-nearest-neighbor competing interactions and the corresponding version of the simple Ising model are studied, and their general universality aspects are inspected by means of a detailed finite size scaling (FSS) analysis. We find that the random bond SAF model obeys weak universality, hyperscaling, and exhibits a strong saturating behavior of the specific heat due to the competing nature of interactions. On the other hand, for the random Ising model we encounter some difficulties as regards a definite discrimination between the two well-known scenarios of the logarithmic corrections versus the weak universality.

It presents a hybrid approach based on the paradigm of Reservoir Computing. The practical applications based on recurrent spiking neurons are limited due to their non-trivial learning algorithms. In the paradigm of Reservoir Computing, instead of training the whole recurrent network only the output layer (known as readout neurons) are trained. These recurrent neural networks are termed as microcircuits which are viewed as basic computational units in cortical computation. These microcircuits are connected as columns which are linked with other neighboring columns in cortical areas. These columns read out information from each other and can serve both as reservoir and readout. The design space for this paradigm is split into three domains; front end, reservoir, and back end. This work contributes to the identification of suitable front and back end processing techniques along with stable and compact reservoir dynamics, which provides a reliable framework for classification related problems.","School of Computing, Electronics and Maths"

The epidemic thresholds known as the basic reproduction numbers and equilibria for the models are determined and stabilities are investigated. The reproduction numbers for the models are compared to assess the impact of the vaccines currently under development. The centre manifold theory is used to show the existence of backward bifurcation when the associated reproduction number is less than unity and that the unique endemic equilibrium is locally asymptotically stable when the associated reproduction number is greater than unity. From the study we conclude that the pre-exposure vaccine currently under development coupled with chemoprophylaxis for the latently infected and treatment of infectives is more effective when compared to the post-exposure vaccine currently under development for the latently infected coupled with treatment of the infectives.","School of Computing, Electronics and Maths"

Fytas,Entropic sampling via Wang-Landau random walks in dominant energy subspaces,"Dominant energy subspaces of statistical systems are defined with the help of restrictive conditions on various characteristics of the energy distribution, such as the probability density and the fourth order Binder’s cumulant. Our analysis generalizes the ideas of the critical minimum energy subspace (CRMES) technique, applied previously to study the specific heat’s finite-size scaling. Here, we illustrate alternatives that are useful for the analysis of further finite-size anomalies and the behavior of the corresponding dominant subspaces is presented for the two-dimensional (2D) Baxter-Wu and the 2D and 3D Ising models. In order to show that a CRMES technique is adequate for the study of magnetic anomalies, we study and test simple methods which provide the means for an accurate determination of the energy–order-parameter (E,M) histograms via Wang-Landau random walks. The 2D Ising model is used as a test case and it is shown that high-level Wang-Landau sampling schemes yield excellent estimates for all magnetic properties. Our estimates compare very well with those of the traditional Metropolis method. The relevant dominant energy subspaces and dominant magnetization subspaces scale as expected with exponents α∕ν and γ∕ν, respectively. Using the Metropolis method we examine the time evolution of the corresponding dominant magnetization subspaces and we uncover the reasons behind the inadequacy of the Metropolis method to produce a reliable estimation scheme for the tail regime of the order-parameter distribution.","School of Computing, Electronics and Maths"

We extract information for the probability distributions of the specific heat peaks over samples of random fields. This permits us to obtain the phase diagram and present the finite-size behavior of the specific heat. The question of saturation of the specific heat is re-examined and it is shown that the open problem of universality for the random-field Ising model is strongly influenced by the lack of self-averaging of the model.

The graphical language is a simple form of Petri net with some notational changes that allow it to express sensory input. Once the Petri net is designed and tested, it can be output in a number of different forms, including PLC (programmable logic controller) ladder logic diagrams, and various high-level languages including Java and Visual Basic.
The main features of this tool are the ability to rapidly construct sophisticated control systems that include a large amount of distributed and concurrent behavior; the ability to compile to both general purpose computer and PLC forms; and the ability to separate the description of the behaviour from the implementation instance.
This tutorial is intended to guide the user through their first use of the tool. It has been written with version 1.1 (build 20060917) in mind, so if you have an earlier version, you might like to start by going through the installation section and installing the latest version.

We focus on the dependence of the transport on the strength of an applied magnetic field B. With increasing field strength the classical dynamics changes from mixed to regular phase space. Averaging out the quantum fluctuations, we find an excellent agreement between the quantum and classical transport coefficients in the complete range of field strengths. This allows an overall description of the nonmonotonic behavior of the average magnetoconductance in terms of the corresponding classical trajectories, thus, establishing a basic tool useful in the design and analysis of experiments.","School of Computing, Electronics and Maths"

The volume of this device is approximately 100 mm3. ANSYS finite element analysis (FEA) has been used to determine the optimum geometry for the microgenerator. Electromagnetic FEA simulations using Ansoft’s Maxwell 3D software have been performed to determine the voltage generated from a single beam generator design. The predicted voltage levels of 0.7–4.15 V can be generated for a two-pole arrangement by tuning the damping factor to achieve maximum displacement for a given input excitation. Experimental results from the microgenerator demonstrate a maximum power output of 104 nW for 0.4g (g=9.81 m s−1) input acceleration at 1.615 kHz.

The data used for the survival analysis were collected from 100 women who had been clinically diagnosed with breast disease in the form of carcinoma or benign conditions. The data set consists of seven different histological and cytological prognostic factors and two corresponding outputs to be predicted (whether the patient is alive or dead within 5 years of diagnosis). The MLFFBPNN, FK-NN and LR based indices identified different subsets of the factors as the most significant sets. We therefore suggest that it could be dangerous to rely on one method's outcome for assessment of such factors. It should also be noted that ""S-phase fraction"" (SPF) is the common cytological factor identified by all three methods while none of the three methods identified another cytological factor, namely ""minimum (start) nuclear pleomorphism index"" (NPImin). We, therefore, conclude that ""S-phase fraction"" and ""minimum (start) nuclear pleomorphism index"" appear to be the most and least important prognostic factors, respectively, for survival analysis in breast cancer patients, and should be investigated thoroughly in future clinical studies in oncology.","School of Computing, Electronics and Maths"

The novelty of this model is that it automatically customises transactions to the requirements of design activities. In addition, this model is believed to improve concurrency, fault tolerance, facilitate interaction between and co-operation among the participating systems involved in design activities. The proposed model is formally specified using CCS (Calculus of Communicating Systems) language.

The relative entropy induces a metric, the so-called information or Fisher–Rao metric, on the space of parameters and the geometrical invariants of this metric carry information about the phase structure of the model. In various models the scalar curvature, ℛ, of the information metric has been found to diverge at the phase transition point and a plausible scaling relation postulated. For spin models the necessity of calculating in non-zero field has limited analytic consideration to one-dimensional, mean-field and Bethe lattice Ising models. We extend the list somewhat in the current note by considering the one-dimensional Potts model, the two-dimensional Ising model coupled to two-dimensional quantum gravity and the three-dimensional spherical model. We note that similar ideas have been applied to elucidate possible critical behaviour in families of black hole solutions in four space-time dimensions.

A proactive approach is characterized by a shift of emphasis from reacting to load imbalance to avoiding its occurrence. In contrast, in a reactive load sharing scheme, activity is triggered when a processing node is either overloaded or underloaded. The main drawback of this approach is that a load imbalance is allowed to develop before costly corrective action is taken. Concert is a load sharing scheme for loosely-coupled distributed systems. Under this scheme, load and task behaviour information is collected and cached in advance of when it is needed. Concert uses Linux as a platform for development. Implemented partially in kernel space and partially in user space, it achieves transparency to users and applications whilst keeping the extent of kernel modifications to a minimum. Non-preemptive task transfers are used exclusively, motivated by lower complexity, lower overheads and faster transfers. The goal is to minimize the average response-time of tasks. Concert is compared with other schemes by considering the level of transparency it provides with respect to users, tasks and the underlying operating system.

We address the question, whether a relevance criterion of this type is applicable to the case of spin models coupled to different kinds of random graphs. The geometrical fluctuation exponent appearing in Luck’s criterion is precisely determined for the cases of two-dimensional Poissonian Voronoï–Delaunay random lattices and planar, “fat” ϕ3 Feynman diagrams. While previous work for the latter graphs is in accord with the determined relevance threshold, a preliminary analysis of the results of a Monte Carlo simulation of the three-states Potts model on Poissonian Voronoï lattices presented here does not meet the expectations from the relevance criterion.

In recent years, several prognostic markers have been used as indicators of disease progression in oncology. However, the rapid increase in the discovery of novel prognostic markers resulting from the development in medical technology, has dictated the need for developing reliable methods for extracting clinically significant markers where complex and nonlinear interactions between these markers naturally exist. The aim of this paper is to investigate the fuzzy k-nearest neighbor (FK-NN) classifier as a fuzzy logic method that provides a certainty degree for prognostic decision and assessment of the markers, and to compare it with: 1) logistic regression as a statistical method and 2) multilayer feedforward backpropagation neural networks an artificial neural-network tool, the latter two techniques having been widely used for oncological prognosis. In order to achieve this aim, breast and prostate cancer data sets are considered as benchmarks for this analysis.

Three edge detection algorithms have been used and after detection several optimization methods have been employed to get the accurate contour from three detected contours. Finally to achieve higher accuracy of detection, active contour model (ACM), snake, has been used after the contour detected by previous methods.","School of Computing, Electronics and Maths,School of Mechanical, Aerospace and Automotive Engineering"

Assuming that finite-size scaling holds, we show that the conventional Kosterlitz-Thouless scaling predictions for these thermodynamic functions are not mutually compatible unless they are modified by multiplicative logarithmic corrections. We identify these logarithmic corrections analytically in the case of the specific heat and numerically in the case of the susceptibility. The techniques presented here are general and can be used to check the compatibility of scaling behaviour of odd and even thermodynamic functions in other models too.

However, there is a large source of knowledge that is often overlooked by the knowledge engineer, and that is information direct from the process that you are trying to model. Unfortunately this data, when in its raw form, is unusable by a standard expert system; what is needed is some way of extracting the useful information, the patterns, from the data. In other words some form of data mining needs to be performed. Database mining systems are useful for detecting trends in large quantities of data, but they function best with some sort of guidance. This is the role we suggest for the expert. In such ""hybrid"" systems, the system does most of the knowledge acquisition itself, but the expert determines what sort of knowledge should be acquired and from which sources. The TIGON system is being developed to detect and diagnose faults in an industrial gas turbine engine. The aim of the TIGON project is to produce a similar a set of knowledge bases as produced manually in the TIGER project. An additional aim is to modify the TIGON-produced knowledge bases so that they are applicable to further turbine systems.

The questions how to define inventory optimization tasks in such environment and how to interpret optimal solutions arise. This paper considers the modification of EOQ formula in the presence of imprecisely estimated parameters. For example, holding and ordering costs are often not precisely known and are usually expressed by linguistic terms such as: ""Holding cost is approximately of value c,"", or: ""Ordering cost is about value c, or more"". These imprecise parameters are presented by fuzzy numbers, defined on a bounded interval on the axis of real numbers.

It is supposed that customer demand is uncertain and described by imprecise linguistic terms defined by fuzzy sets. For example, ""demand is about d"", or ""demand is more or less between d, and d,"", or more complex ""demand is about d, but there is a possibility to be 2d"", etc. Four alternative replenishment policies are considered in particular: (1) fixed cycle-fixed order quantity, (2) fixed cycle-variable order quantity, (3) variable review period-fixed order quantity, and (4) variable review period-variable order quantity. With each replenishment policy a number of criteria are associated. Typical criteria examined are: (a) average fill rate, (b) inventory holding cost per item delivered, (c) regularity of the replenishment orders with regard to time and quantity of ordering. Criteria values for each replenishment policy can be obtained either analytically or by using a simulation technique, or they are linguistic subjective judgements defined by fuzzy sets, like, for example, the values of criterion (c). In order to choose the best replenishment policy, a procedure for selecting a compromised optimistic-pessimistic solution is developed and applied. It enables the comparison of a finite number of alternative replenishment policies with respect to a number of criteria, simultaneously, when the criteria values are either cardinal or linguistic terms, and the relative weights of the criteria are vaguely expressed. An illustrative example is given.","School of Computing, Electronics and Maths"

For the one-dimensional Ising model the scalar curvature, Script R, of this metric can be calculated explicitly in the thermodynamic limit and is found to be Script R = 1 + cosh(h)/√sinh2(h) + exp(−4β). This is positive definite and, for physical fields and temperatures, diverges only at the zero-temperature, zero-field 'critical point' of the model. In this paper we calculate Script R for the one-dimensional q-state Potts model finding an expression of the form Script R = A(q, β, h) + B(q, β, h)/√η(q, β, h), where η(q, β, h) is the Potts analogue of sinh2(h) + exp(−4β). This is no longer positive definite, but once again it diverges only at the critical point in the space of real parameters. We remark, however, that a naive analytic continuation to complex field reveals a further divergence in the Ising and Potts curvatures at the Lee–Yang edge.","School of Computing, Electronics and Maths"

In view of the notorious problems of clearly resolving the Kosterlitz–Thouless scenario in the two-dimensional XY model numerically, the F model in particular constitutes an instructive reference case for the simulational description of this type of phase transition. We present a loop-cluster update Monte Carlo study of the square-lattice F model, with a focus on the properties not exactly known, such as the polarizability or the scaling dimension in the critical phase.

It is illustrated that we can predict with high accuracy the critical part of the energy space and by using this restricted part we can extend our simulations to larger systems and improve the accuracy of critical parameters. It is proposed that the extensions of the finite-size critical part of the energy space, determining the specific heat, satisfy a scaling law involving the thermal critical exponent. The method is applied successfully for the estimation of the scaling behavior of specific heat of both square and simple cubic Ising lattices. The proposed scaling law is verified by estimating the thermal critical exponent from the finite-size behavior of the critical part of the energy space.

This explains the applicability of the Lee–Yang theory of partition function zeros to the ASEP normalization.

In this paper we consider the exact solution of the parallel-update ASEP, a special case of the Nagel–Schreckenberg model for traffic flow, in which the ASEP phase transitions can be interpreted as jamming transitions, and find that Lee–Yang theory still applies. We show that the parallel-update ASEP normalization can be expressed as one of several equivalent two-dimensional lattice path problems involving weighted Dyck or Motzkin paths. We introduce the notion of thermodynamic equivalence for such paths and show that the robustness of the general form of the ASEP phase diagram under various update dynamics is a consequence of this thermodynamic equivalence.

Further, we extend HIV/AIDS vaccination model with condom use by incorporating treatment which allows AIDS patients to undergo amelioration. The thresholds and equilibria for the models are determined, and stabilities analyzed. The basic reproductive numbers for the models are computed and compared to assess the possible community benefits of using prophylactic vaccines, condoms and treatment with amelioration of AIDS patients. We conclude from the study that vaccination and condom use can reduce the basic reproductive number (R0) to values below unity but treatment with amelioration intended to lengthen the lives of AIDS patients may result in more numbers of HIV infections and fail to reduce R0 to values less than unity as intended for disease control. © World Scientific Publishing Company.","School of Computing, Electronics and Maths"

Contrary to previous conjectures, the ground state of each disorder replica is nondegenerate up to a global O(2) rotation. The scaling of spin and chiral defect energies induced by applying several different sets of boundary conditions exhibits strong crossover effects. This suggests that previous calculations have yielded results far from the asymptotic regime. The novel algorithm and the aspect-ratio scaling technique consistently give θs=−0.308(30) and θc=−0.114(16) for the spin and chiral stiffness exponents, respectively.","School of Computing, Electronics and Maths"

The random-fields are obtained from a bimodal distribution, that is we consider the discrete (±Δ) case and the model is studied on cubic lattices with sizes 4≤L ≤20. In order to extract information for the relevant probability distributions of the specific heat and susceptibility peaks, large samples of random-field realizations are generated. The general aspects of the model's scaling behavior are discussed and the process of averaging finite-size anomalies in random systems is re-examined under the prism of the lack of self-averaging of the specific heat and susceptibility of the model.","School of Computing, Electronics and Maths"

Recently it has been observed that the latter are related to the critical properties of a tricritical Potts model with the same central charge. We apply the KPZ formalism to develop a related prediction for the case of Potts models coupled to quantum gravity and employ numerical simulation methods to confirm it for the Ising case q=2.

RFID is an automatic identification technology whereby digital data encoded in a transponder is captured by a reader using radio waves. The communication process between the transponder and the reader involves the transmitting of energy by the reader's antenna, which is picked up by transponder's antenna and some of it reflected back using backscattering modulation. Nonetheless RFID is still a relatively immature technology and many of its characteristics in real-life industrial scenarios are not yet fully understood. For example, the performance of RFID can be severely hampered by the presence of metals and liquids in the tagged product or extreme conditions in the environment. Hence it is important to examine the practical feasibility of RFID in harsher surroundings. This research is an attempt to examine the practical issues associated with using RFID in a complex metal environment and the interference of RF waves caused by metals in particular.

The model is formulated using integro-differential equations, which are shown to be equivalent to delay differential equations with delay due to incubation period. The threshold and equilibria for the model are determined and stabilities are examined. We extend the model to incorporate the effects of condom use as another preventive strategy for controlling HIV/AIDS. Basic reproductive numbers for these models are computed and compared to assess the effectiveness of male circumcision and condom use in a community. The models are numerically analysed to assess the effects of the two preventive strategies on the transmission dynamics of HIV/AIDS. We conclude from the study that in the continuing absence of a preventive vaccine or cure for HIV/AIDS, male circumcision is a potential effective preventive strategy of HIV/AIDS to help communities slow the development of the HIV/AIDS epidemic and that it is even more effective if implemented jointly with condom use. The study provides insights into the possible community benefits that male circumcision and condom use as preventive strategies provide in slowing or curtailing the HIV/AIDS epidemic. © 2007 Elsevier Ltd.

Here, an efficient optimization heuristic for the much less discussed case of continuous spins is introduced, based on the combination of an embedding of Ising spins into the continuous rotators and an appropriate variant of a genetic algorithm. Statistical techniques for insuring high reliability in finding (numerically) exact ground states are discussed, and the method is benchmarked against the simulated annealing approach.","School of Computing, Electronics and Maths"

While the influence of such connectivity disorder is rather mild for ferromagnets in that an ordered phase persists and only the properties of the phase transition are substantially changed in some cases, any finite-temperature transition is wiped out due to frustration for some of the antiferromagnetic models. A wealth of different phenomena is observed: While for the annealed average of quantum gravity some graphs can adapt dynamically to allow the emergence of a Néel ordered phase, this is not possible for the quenched average, where a zero-temperature spin-glass phase appears instead.

Younas",Consumer-centric QoS-aware selection of web services,"There exist many web services which exhibit similar functional characteristics. It is imperative to provide service consumers with facilities for selecting required web services according to their non-functional characteristics or quality of service (QoS). However, the selection process is greatly complicated by the distinct views of service providers and consumers on the services QoS. For instance, they may have distinct views of the service reliability—wherein a consumer considers that a service is reliable if its success rate is higher than 99%, while a provider may consider its service as reliable if its success rate is higher than 90%. The aim of this paper is to resolve such conflicts and to ensure consensus on the QoS characteristics in the selection of web services. It proposes a QoS Consensus Moderation Approach (QCMA) in order to perform QoS consensus and to alleviate the differences on QoS characteristics in the selection of web services. The proposed approach is implemented as a prototype tool and is tested on a case study of a hotel booking web service. Experimental results show that the proposed approach greatly improves the service selection process in a dynamic and uncertain environment of web services.","School of Computing, Electronics and Maths"

Our results improve the original estimates of Rastelli et al. and verify all the generally accepted predictions of the finite-size scaling theory of first-order transitions, including transition point shifts, thermal, and magnetic anomalies. However, two of our findings are not compatible with current phenomenological expectations. The behavior of transition points, derived from the number-of-phases parameter, is not in accordance with the theoretically conjectured exponentially small shift behavior and the well-known double Gaussian approximation does not correctly describe higher correction terms of the energy cumulants. It is argued that this discrepancy has its origin in the commonly neglected contributions from domain wall corrections.","School of Computing, Electronics and Maths"

We point out that the origin of such estimates in the same time series often results in pronounced cross correlations which are usually ignored even in high-precision studies, generically leading to significant underestimation of statistical fluctuations. We suggest to use a simple extension of the conventional analysis taking correlation effects into account, which leads to improved estimators with often substantially reduced statistical fluctuations at almost no extra cost in terms of computation time.

The approach is able to bound average queuing delay but still achieve a high system utilization by regulating traffic arrival rate implicitly through a movable queuing threshold. The queuing threshold is adjusted dynamically through feedback of average queuing delay measurement. Consequently, packets are dropped dynamically with respect to the changes of queuing threshold and the packets loss event served as an implicit congestion indicator. Three major contributions are given in this paper: (1) a discrete time queuing model is developed to derive the mapping table of average queuing delay and queuing threshold; (2) a traffic model that models LRD aggregated Internet traffic through superposing of N MMBP-2 arrival processes; (3) a closed-loop feedback control to control queuing delay at its target level based on expected system utilization. Matlab is used to perform queuing analysis and simulation. Statistical evaluation is performed to show the efficiency and accuracy of the analytical and simulation results.","School of Computing, Electronics and Maths"

We consider the case R=Jnnn/Jnn=1, for which the pure model is known to have a columnar ground state where rows of nearest-neighbor spins up and down alternate and undergo a weak first-order phase transition from the ordered to the paramagnetic state. With the introduction of quenched bond randomness we observe the effects signaling the expected conversion of the first-order phase transition to a second-order phase transition and using the Lee–Kosterlitz method, we quantitatively verify this conversion. The emerging, under random bonds, continuous transition shows a strongly saturating specific heat behavior, corresponding to a negative exponent α, and belongs to a new distinctive universality class with ν=1.135(11), γ/ν=1.744(9), and β/ν=0.124(8). Thus, our results for the critical exponents support an extensive but weak universality and the emerged continuous transition has the same magnetic critical exponent (but a different thermal critical exponent) as a wide variety of two-dimensional (2d) systems without and with quenched disorder.","School of Computing, Electronics and Maths"

The epidemic threshold and equilibria for the model are determined and stabilities are investigated. Comprehensive qualitative analysis of the model including invariance of solutions and permanence are carried out. The epidemic threshold known as the basic reproductive number suggests that heterosexuality, homosexuality, and bisexuality influence the growth of the epidemic in HIV/AIDS affected populations and the partial reproductive number (homosexuality induced or heterosexuality and bisexuality induced) with the larger value influences the overall dynamics of the epidemic in a setting. Numerical simulations of the model show that as long as one of the partial reproductive numbers is greater than unity, the disease will exist in the population. We conclude from the study that homosexuality and bisexuality enlarge the epidemic in a heterosexual setting.

The objective of this novel algorithm is to solve the problem of energy and congestion control on wireless sensor network routing process. This novel algorithm is able to achieve better load balance and prolong the network lifetime. In this novel algorithm we combine the pheromone released by multi-ant colonies and residual energy as the algorithm control factor. Furthermore, we also introduce the competition mechanism among multiant colonies to avoid the simplex convergence in our algorithm. In this way, the novel algorithm controls the network traffic congestion effectively and balances the energy consumption for sensor networks. Simulation results in this paper demonstrate that this novel algorithm has better performance on load balance comparing with fundamental ant colony algorithm.","School of Computing, Electronics and Maths"

The second-order phase transition, emerging under random bonds from the second-order regime of the pure model, has the same values of critical exponents as the 2d Ising universality class, with the effect of the bond disorder on the specific heat being well described by double-logarithmic corrections. On the other hand, the second-order transition, emerging under bond randomness from the first-order regime of the pure model, has a distinctive universality class with v=1.30(6) and β/v=0.128(5). These results amount to a strong violation of universality principle of critical phenomena, since these two second-order transitions, with different sets of critical exponents, are between the same ferromagnetic and paramagnetic phases. Furthermore, the latter of these two sets of results supports an extensive but weak universality, since it has the same magnetic critical exponent (but a different thermal critical exponent) as a wide variety of 2d systems with and without quenched disorder.

The combination of the heavy (roughly 40kg) suit, physical exertion, and the environment in which these suits are worn can cause the wearer's temperature to rise to uncomfortable and potentially dangerous levels during missions. This paper reports on the development of a wearable wireless sensing system suitable for deployment in such manned bomb disposal missions. In its final form, the system will be capable of making in-network autonomous decisions related to the actuation of cooling within the suit, in order to increase the comfort of the wearer. In addition, it will allow an external observer to remotely monitor the health and comfort of the operative. Laboratory experiments with the instrumented suit show how skin temperature varies differently for different skin sites, motivating the need for multiple, distributed sensing.

Our simulations are carried out for large ensembles of disorder realizations and lattices with linear sizes L in the range L=8−64L=8−64. We apply well-established finite-size scaling techniques and concepts from the scaling theory of disordered systems to describe the nature of the phase transition of the disordered model, departing gradually from the fixed point of the pure system. Our analysis (based on the determination of the critical exponents) shows that the 3D random-bond Ising model belongs to the same universality class with the site- and bond-dilution models, providing a single universality class for the 3D Ising model with these three types of quenched uncorrelated disorder.","School of Computing, Electronics and Maths"

It is argued that the effective design of an e-voting system and its viability can be enhanced by a two-pronged approach to robustness. First, it requires a clear distinction between two forms of robustness: robustness at protocol level and robustness at system level. Second, selected technologies should be integrated into an appropriate architecture in order to address robustness simultaneously at the two levels. The proposed approach is illustrated by the design and implementation of an e-voting system based on the FOO92 protocol. A service-oriented architecture supported by onion routing forms the basis of the system. It facilitates the distribution of tasks and state, the dynamic path configuration and the just-in-time (JIT) composition of the election system.

The main novelty of this article stems from the utilization of a gradient based adaptive scheme that is able to adapt the controller's gain ruling the rising and settling time of the robot and up to now has been ad-hoc selected. The proposed adaptation scheme is based on the robot's path tracking errors and is able to provide an on-line adjustment for the performance improvement, independently of the selected path type. Multiple experimental test cases, including the movement of the robot on various path profiles, prove the efficacy of the proposed scheme.","School of Computing, Electronics and Maths"

In this paper, a simple deterministic HIV/AIDS model incorporating condom use, sexual partner acquisition, behavior change and treatment as HIV/AIDS control strategies is formulated using a system of ordinary differential equations with the object of applying it to the current South African situation. Firstly, a theoretical analysis of the model is presented. The analysis of the model shows that the disease free equilibrium point is globally asymptotically stable for the epidemic threshold R (the model reproduction number) less than unit and unstable when this threshold is greater than unit. A unique endemic equilibrium, whose local stability near the threshold R, is determined using the center manifold theory, is shown to be locally asymptotically stable for R>1. Global stability of the endemic equilibrium is shown for a special case whenever R>1. Secondly, the model is fitted to data from UNAIDS/WHO on HIV/AIDS in South Africa. Based on the fit to the prevalence data, projections are made beyond 2007 on the course of the epidemic for various levels of interventions. The results compare very well with other research outcomes on the HIV/AIDS epidemic in South Africa. Projections are made to track the changes in the number of individuals who will be under treatment, an important group as far as public health planning is concerned. The epidemiological implications of such projections on public health planning and management are discussed.","School of Computing, Electronics and Maths"

Stream-flow series of the annual maximum, annual minimum and annual mean in Ahvaz hydrometric station as representative of the watershed have been considered. In order to determine the change points, we use the Pettitt test while the trend in the annual stream-flow series of this station is evaluated by the Mann-Kendall test. However, the Pettitt test cannot detect any change point in these series, but the Mann-Kendall test shows that there is an increasing trend. This increasing trend has no fitness with observed data in recent decade. Therefore, the potential change points were determined and consequently, these series converted to two sub-series based on the results obtained from the Pettitt test, wide variation from human activities and variation of hydro climatic conditions. We then applied the Mann-Kendall test in these two sub-series which showed significant decreasing trend in both of them. From this method, it can be concluded that the averages of the second sub-series are larger than the first one in the three annual stream-flow series. This increasing ratio is equal to 1.34, 1.16 and 1.2 for stream-flow series of annual maximum, annual minimum and annual mean respectively. These changes are similar to changes in annual rainfall time series. We can say that the sudden increase of precipitation in recent decades makes the averages of the second sub-series larger. Results showed that inspite of wide range human induced changes, stream-flow series is more affected from the watershed rainfall time series variations. In addition, significant decreasing trend in the two sub-series can be due to the following causes: the growth of population, temperature rise, construction of three dams on the Karun River, implementing the different projects for developing agricultural, and conservation from soil and water resources.","School of Computing, Electronics and Maths"

Based on experimental data, this paper quantifies the spacial-temporal variations in the cabin’s environment by using Mutual Information (MI) as a similarity measure. The overarching aim for the work is to find optimal (but practical) locations for sensors that: i) can produce accurate estimates of temperature at locations where sensors would be difficult to place, such as on an occupant’s face or abdomen and ii) thus, support the development of occupant rather than cabin focused HVAC control algorithms. When applied to experimental data from stable and hot/cold soaking scenarios, the method proposed successfully identified practical sensor locations which estimate face and abdomen temperatures of an occupant with less than 0.7°C and 0.5°C error, respectively.","School of Computing, Electronics and Maths"

Fytas,Monte Carlo study of the triangular Blume-Capel model under bond randomness,"The effects of bond randomness on the universality aspects of a two-dimensional (d=2) Blume-Capel model embedded in the triangular lattice are discussed. The system is studied numerically in both its first- and second-order phase-transition regimes by a comprehensive finite-size scaling analysis for a particularly suitable value of the disorder strength. We find that our data for the second-order phase transition, emerging under random bonds from the second-order regime of the pure model, are compatible with the universality class of the two-dimensional (2D) random Ising model. Furthermore, we find evidence that, the second-order transition emerging under bond randomness from the first-order regime of the pure model, belongs again to the same universality class. Although the first finding reinforces the scenario of strong universality in the 2D Ising model with quenched disorder, the second is in difference from the critical behavior, emerging under randomness, in the cases of the ex-first-order transitions of the Potts model. Finally, our results verify previous renormalization-group calculations on the Blume-Capel model with disorder in the crystal-field coupling.","School of Computing, Electronics and Maths"

Eliminatingsuch experiences is important for enhancingadolescent wellbeing, and the provision of good quality relationships and sex education (RSE) is needed. Engaging young people in sensitive subjectmatters in RSE can be challenging, and using Serious Gaming technology may support young people and educators in this process. This paper describes the use of Intervention mapping (IM) in the development of a serious game on the topic of sexual coercion for use in RSE. IM is a process that draws on stakeholder engagement and the theory and evidence base to support health improvement intervention planning. Serious game developers transformed the game concept ‘flat plan’ into an interactive gameshow. The game is teacher ledand aims to engage students in gameplay and discussion around the issue of sexual coercion. The final product known as PR:EPARe (Positive Relationships: Eliminating Coercion and Pressure in Adolescent Relationships) is the subject of an ongoing cluster Randomised Controlled Trial (RCT) in local schools. Early data analysis shows improvements in psychological preparedness for dealing with sexual coercion against some change objectives. This work represents the first attempt to use IM in the development of a Serious Game and the use of Serious Gaming for RSE delivery.

It may therefore be one of the most common, potentially modifiable HIV risk factors in this region. A deterministic system of ordinary differential equations incorporating heterogeneity and biased sexual preferences is formulated to assess the effects of alcohol consumption on the transmission dynamics of the disease in heterosexual settings. Extensive qualitative analysis of the model is carried out and epidemic threshold such as the alcohol-induced reproductive number (RA), and equilibria are derived and their stabilities examined. The disease-free equilibrium is found to be globally attracting whenever the reproductive number is less than unity. In the model, heterosexuality is the source of transmissions, and therefore, targeting a reduction of the basic reproductive number (R0) should be primary objective for any intervention programme. We show that the preference to form partnerships amongst the heterogeneous groups influences the severity of disease and its evolution, and consequently the rate of partnership formation between females and alcohol consumers and their relative infectiousness over nondrinkers has a huge positive correlation with the alcohol-induced reproductive number and hence the epidemic. The proportion or absolute number of drinkers is shown to have minimal influence on the disease dynamics, and in a community with alcohol consumers, it is more prudent to reduce their risk sexual behavior rather than to fight the spread of alcohol consumption. Thus, intervention measures targeted at reducing heterogeneous group interactions and behavior change are the key to disease control in these settings.","School of Computing, Electronics and Maths"

Through the notion of 'intuitive guided' learning, this paper presents an approach which seeks to facilitate a structured learning experience whilst allowing learners to explore a non-linear environment. To do so, a framework is presented which externalizes the assessment process in a serious game, whilst also providing a means for game content to be adapted dynamically to translate the outcomes of the assessment process to effective feedback. A developed prototype is implemented to examine the theory in-practice through the case of a game for civil defence training in schools. Using this prototype, a range of methods in which achievements might be related to learner actions are introduced, and their subsequent implications for intuitive learning discussed. Furthermore, the prototype illustrates how assessment rules can be defined as external to the game and subsequently used to generate feedback for a virtual companion who assumes the role of a more-able partner. The long-term potential of such methods as a source of data on player behaviour is discussed, suggesting further benefits the technique might offer to educators seeking to introduce game-based learning within the curriculum in a blended fashion.",

This concept is important in a decision-theoretic context such as the maintenance problem, as it allows us to explore the effect of parameter uncertainty on the cost and the resulting recommendations. To reduce the computational effort required for the calculation of EVPIs, we have used Gaussian process (GP) emulators to approximate the cost rate model. Results from the analysis allow us to identify the most important parameters in terms of the benefit of 'learning' by focussing on the partial expected value of perfect information for a parameter. The analysis determines the optimal solution and the expected related cost when the parameters are unknown and partially known. This type of analysis can be used to ensure that both maintenance calculations and resulting recommendations are sufficiently robust. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd.","School of Computing, Electronics and Maths"

When considering Algebraic Petri nets (APNs) for modeling and model checking for verification, all the proofs must be redone after each iteration which is impractical both in terms of time and space.

However, the main disadvantage of fluoroscopic imaging is the lack of soft tissue information and harmful radiation. In contrast, ultrasound (US) has the advantages of low-cost, non-radiation, and high contrast in soft tissue. In this paper we propose a framework to extract the catheter from both X-ray and US images in real time for cardiac interventions. The catheter extraction from X-ray images is based on SURF features, local patch analysis and Kalman filtering to acquire a set of sorted key points representing the catheter. At the same time, the transformation between the X-ray and US images can be obtained via 2D/3D rigid registration between a 3D model of the US probe and its projection on X-ray images. By backprojecting the information about the catheter location in the X-ray images to the US images the search space can be drastically reduced. The extraction of the catheter from US is based on 3D SURF feature clusters, graph model building, A* algorithm and B-spline smoothing. Experiments show the overall process can be achieved in 2.72 seconds for one frame and the reprojected error is 1.99 mm on average.","School of Computing, Electronics and Maths"

We focus here on the issue of carrying out sensitivity analysis of availability to determine the influence of the input parameters. The main purpose is to study the sensitivity of the system availability with respect to the changes in the main parameters. In the simplest case that the failure repair process is (continuous time/discrete state) Markovian, explicit formulae are well known. Unfortunately, in more general cases availability is often a complicated function of the parameters without closed form solution. Thus, the computation of sensitivity measures would be time-consuming or even infeasible.,In this paper, we show how Sobol and other related sensitivity measures can be cheaply computed to measure how changes in the model inputs (failure/repair times) influence the outputs (availability measure). We use a Bayesian framework, called the Bayesian analysis of computer code output (BACCO) which is based on using the Gaussian process as an emulator (i.e., an approximation) of complex models/functions. This approach allows effective sensitivity analysis to be achieved by using far smaller numbers of model runs than other methods.,The emulator-based sensitivity measure is used to examine the influence of the failure and repair densities' parameters on the system availability. We discuss how to apply the methods practically in the reliability context, considering in particular the selection of parameters and prior distributions and how we can ensure these may be considered independent—one of the key assumptions of the Sobol approach. The method is illustrated on several examples, and we discuss the further implications of the technique for reliability and maintenance analysis.","School of Computing, Electronics and Maths"

In this configuration an enhancement of the LSPR phenomenon with high sensitivity performances and a uniform near electric field distribution are obtained.

Although information on aerosol properties is available from ground-based measurements, passive remote sensing using satellite measurements would offer the advantage of large spatial coverage with good temporal resolution, even though, due to light limitations, this is only available during the Arctic summer. However, aerosol optical depth (AOD) retrieval over the Arctic region is a great challenge due to the high reflectance of snow and ice and due to the high solar zenith angle. In this article, we describe a retrieval algorithm using Advanced Along-Track Scanning Radiometer (AATSR) data, a radiometer flying on the European Space Agency (ESA) Environmental Satellite (ENVISAT), which offers two views (near nadir and at 55° forward) at seven wavelengths in the visible thermal-infrared (VIS-TIR). The main idea of the Dual-View Multi-Spectral (DVMS) approach is to use the dual view to separate contributions to reflectance measured at the top of the atmosphere (TOA) due to atmospheric aerosol and the underlying surface. The algorithm uses an analytical snow bidirectional reflectance distribution function (BRDF) model for the estimation of the ratio of snow reflectances in the nadir and forward views, as well as an estimate of the atmospheric contribution to TOA reflectance obtained using the dark pixel method over the adjacent ocean surface, assuming that this value applies over nearby land surfaces in the absence of significant sources across the coastline. An iteration involving all four AATSR wavebands in the visible near-infrared (VIS-NIR) is used to retrieve the relevant information. The method is illustrated for AATSR overpasses over Greenland with clear sky in April 2009. Comparison of the retrieved AOD with AErosol Robotic Network (AERONET) data shows a correlation coefficient of 0.75. The AODs retrieved from AATSR using the DVMS approach and those obtained from AERONET data show similar temporal trends, but the AERONET results are more variable and the highest AOD values are mostly missed by the DVMS approach. Limitations of the DVMS method are discussed. The pure-snow BRDF model needs further correction in order to obtain a better estimation for mixtures of snow and ice. ","School of Computing, Electronics and Maths"

Like many other technologies, the uptake of personalization has been rapid, with inadequate consideration given to its effects. Personalization in e-learning systems also has potential for both harmful and beneficial outcomes, but less is known about its effects. The ethical and social hazards include privacy compromise, lack of control, reduced individual capability, and the commodification of education. Personalization is appearing in many systems already; thus, these hazards may already be occurring. Solutions, more research and community discussion of the issues are needed.

The method is particularly useful to standardize the display of functional information derived from medical imaging and catheter-based measurements. We hypothesized that a similar approach could be possible for the more complex shape of the left atrium (LA) and that the surface flattening could be useful for the management of patients with atrial fibrillation (AF). We implemented an existing surface mesh parameterization approach to flatten and unfold 3D LA models. Mapping errors going from 2D to 3D and the inverse were investigated both qualitatively and quantitatively using synthetic data of regular shapes and computer tomography scans of an anthropomorphic phantom. Testing of the approach was carried out using data from 14 patients undergoing ablation treatment for AF. 3D LA meshes were obtained from magnetic resonance imaging and electroanatomical mapping systems. These were unfolded using the developed approach and used to demonstrate proof-of-concept applications, such as the display of scar information, electrical information and catheter position. The work carried out shows that the unfolding of complex cardiac structures, such as the LA, is feasible and has several potential clinical uses for the management of patients with AF.","School of Computing, Electronics and Maths"

Bangalore and other similar developing cities do not have an adequate number of fixed monitoring stations that could provide a complete coverage of the air pollution levels for the entire city. This can be overcome by using geospatial interpolation techniques that provide a complete coverage of the levels of pollutants. The aim of this study is to locate sample points, characterise distribution patterns, map air pollutant distributions using interpolation techniques, highlight areas exceeding standard levels and in doing so determine spatial and temporal patterns of the levels of air pollutants.

From a review of existing SG evaluation criteria, we define a tailored set of criteria for energy SG development and evaluation. The criteria emphasise the need for the game to increase energy literacy through applicability to real-life energy use/management; clear, actionable goals and feedback; ways of comparing usage socially and personal relevance. Three existing energy games are evaluated according to this framework. The paper concludes by outlining directions for future development of SGs as an effective tool in social science research, including games which inspire reflection on trade-offs and usage at different scales.

The purpose of these games is to enable the generation of predictive behavioural models, and thus design an adaptive and dynamic game promoting responsible energy consumption. Adapting the behaviour of energy consumers to follow environmentally friendly consumption patterns is a central challenge when seeking to address environmental concerns. To perform such adaptation, an understanding of an individual user's traits can allow for customised solutions to be delivered, increasing the likelihood of impact. To assess the usability of the games, domain experts filled in two QUIS questionnaires. The results showed a broadly positive reception of the games' usability; taking into account time, financial and other resources, though they also highlight some areas for future work..

Cardiorespiratory gating can be useful for 3D reconstruction from multiple x-ray views and for reducing misalignments between 3D anatomical models overlaid onto fluoroscopy.,METHODS: The authors propose a novel and potentially clinically useful retrospective cardiorespiratory gating technique. The principal component analysis (PCA) statistical method is used in combination with other image processing operations to make our proposed masked-PCA technique suitable for cardiorespiratory gating. Unlike many previously proposed techniques, our technique is robust to varying image-content, thus it does not require specific catheters or any other optically opaque structures to be visible. Therefore, it works without any knowledge of catheter geometry. The authors demonstrate the application of our technique for the purposes of retrospective cardiorespiratory gating of normal and very low dose x-ray fluoroscopy images.,RESULTS: For normal dose x-ray images, the algorithm was validated using 28 clinical electrophysiology x-ray fluoroscopy sequences (2168 frames), from patients who underwent radiofrequency ablation (RFA) procedures for the treatment of atrial fibrillation and cardiac resynchronization therapy procedures for heart failure. The authors established end-systole, end-expiration, and end-inspiration success rates of 97.0%, 97.9%, and 97.0%, respectively. For very low dose applications, the technique was tested on ten x-ray sequences from the RFA procedures with added noise at signal to noise ratio (SNR) values of √50, √10, √8, √6, √5, √2 and √1 to simulate the image quality of increasingly lower dose x-ray images. Even at the low SNR value of √2, representing a dose reduction of more than 25 times, gating success rates of 89.1%, 88.8%, and 86.8% were established.,CONCLUSIONS: The proposed technique can therefore extract useful information from interventional x-ray images while minimizing exposure to ionizing radiation.","School of Computing, Electronics and Maths"

This paper focuses on evaluating the suitability of four existing thermal comfort models, namely the Predicted Mean Vote (PMV), Taniguchi's model, Zhang's model and Nilsson's model in a variety of car cabin conditions. A series of comfort trials were performed ranging from controlled indoor trials to on-road driving trials. The outputs of all four models were compared to the sensation index reported by the subjects situated in the driver seat. The results show that PMV and Nilsson's model are generally applicable for the car cabin environment, but that they are most accurate when there is a small air temperature rate of change (of under 1.5 °C per minute), giving correlation levels of 0.91 and 0.93 for the two models respectively. Taniguchi's and Zhang's models were found unsuitable for all conditions, with correlation levels ranging between 0.03 and 0.60.

The domain considered is bounded by periodic boundary conditions in the two directions perpendicular to the magnetic field and by two plane Hartmann walls in the third direction. Regimes of high magnetic fields (Hartmann number of up to 896) are reached thanks to a new spectral method using the eigenvectors of the dissipation operator. The decay is found to proceed through two phases: first, energy and integral length scales vary rapidly during a two-dimensionalisation phase extending over approximately a Hartmann friction time. During this phase, the evolution of the former appears significantly more impeded by the presence of walls than that of the latter. Once the large scales are nearly quasi-two-dimensional, the decay results from the competition of a two-dimensional dynamics driven by dissipation in the Hartmann boundary layers and the three-dimensional dynamics of smaller scales. In the later stages of the decay, three-dimensionality subsists under the form of barrel-shaped structures. A purely quasi-two dimensional decay entirely dominated by friction in the Hartmann layers is not reached because of residual dissipation in the bulk. However, this dissipation is not generated by the three-dimensionality that subsists, but by residual viscous friction due to horizontal velocity gradients. In the process, the energy in the velocity component aligned with the magnetic field is found to be strongly suppressed, as is skewness. This result reproduces the experimental findings of Kolesnikov & Tsinober (Fluid Dyn., vol. 9, 1974, pp. 621–624), where, as in the present simulations, Hartmann walls were present.","School of Computing, Electronics and Maths"

It is usually absent or impaired in children with autism, which means that they often find it difficult to share attention with an adult or peer about a toy by following gaze, pointing and alternating gaze, but also showing interest to the other person. Joint attention difficulties can also be a prognostic indicator of autism. Research on the use of tablets to develop skills in autism is limited. In order to understand current practice, semi structured interviews with 16 school staff members and non-obtrusive observations of 12 pupils interacting with the teacher using iPads were held in three UK schools (one mainstream and two special needs). 

All teachers used teaching strategies to promote joint attention on a daily basis, a few used targeted interventions for joint attention and even less used iPads in general in their classroom. Participants expressed different opinions about the effectiveness of teaching strategies and iPad use in developing joint attention skills since it relied on their ability to implement them appropriately and their knowledge of each child. 

The observations showed that teachers used a variety of evidence-based strategies to engage their pupils with autism in joint attention opportunities but that there was little use of iPads. The iPad was mainly used as a reward, a motivator to direct and sustain pupils’ attention, to practice turn-taking and waiting skills and to teach the curriculum. The research points to the need to provide schools with guidance on how to use tablets to teach joint attention skills and that teachers would welcome opportunities to share knowledge with colleagues and parents so that they can work together.

However, much of that energy is wasted to maintain excess service capacity during periods of low load. In this paper, we investigate the problem of “right-sizing“ data center for energy-efficiency through virtualization which allows consolidation of workloads into smaller number of servers while dynamically powering off the idle ones. In view of the dynamic nature of data centers, we propose a stochastic model based on Queueing theory to capture the main characteristics. Solving this model, we notice that there exists a tradeoff between the energy consumption and performance. We hereby develop a BFGS based algorithm to optimize the tradeoff by searching for the optimal system parameter values for the data center operators to “right-size“ the data centers. We implement our Stochastic Right-sizing Model (SRM) and deploy it in the real-world cloud data center. Experiments with two real-world workload traces show that SRM can significantly reduce the energy consumption while maintaining high performance.","School of Computing, Electronics and Maths"

A high level of satisfaction can increase the motivation of students, their engagement and experience, and therefore improve their learning. This paper is concerned with the investigation of the effect of adaptation based on learning style on students' satisfaction. An adaptive approach, which involves the construction of personalised learning paths based on learning style, was implemented in an adaptive e-learning system. A controlled experiment in this learning environment was conducted with sixty undergraduate students to evaluate their level of satisfaction with the system. The results indicate that the students were generally satisfied with their learning experience. It can be concluded that adaptation of learning content according to learning style can improve student satisfaction and enhance their experience and motivation.

In the case of binary erasure channels (BECs), certain error-prone patterns, known as stopping sets, are proven to cause this performance degradation. A possible approach to diminish this drawback over BECs is to eliminate stopping sets by parity-check matrix extension. Given a parity-check matrix H, and a list L of its stopping sets, we present an integer linear programming (ILP) formulation to find a parity-check equation which eliminates the maximum number of stopping sets in L. One of the distinguishing advantages of the proposed scheme is its flexibility for modifications such as: limiting the weight of the new parity-check row, making the new row redundant or linearly independent, 4-cycle avoidance, and taking into account the sizes of stopping sets. Armed with these adjustments, the method can provide good performance improvements, as evidenced by simulation results. Furthermore, for a given ∈ N, by extending the basic formulation, we provide an ILP formulation for finding a set of size of parity-check equations which can best eliminate the stopping sets in L, among all such sets.

The evolution of the structure is determined indirectly from a carefully built transformation of the eigenvector matrices of the coupling Laplacians, which are guaranteed to change smoothly in time. In turn, this allows one to extend the master stability function formalism, which can be used to assess the stability of a synchronized state. This approach is independent from the particular topologies that the network visits, and is not restricted to commuting structures. Also, it does not depend on the time scale of the evolution, which can be faster than, comparable to, or even secular with respect to the dynamics of the units.","School of Computing, Electronics and Maths"

Menzel",Small differences in seasonal and thermal niches influence elevational limits of native and invasive Balsams,"Recent studies suggest that invasive plant species have colonised mountains to previously unobserved elevations, possibly due to ongoing climate change. Thus, they might pose new threats to high-elevation ecosystems, which are often of high conservation value. Current range predictions are primarily based on climate niche models, however many other factors might also contribute to the species' distribution. 

We studied the species-specific elevational limits of one native (Impatiens noli-tangere) and two invasive balsams (Impatiens glandulifera and Impatiens parviflora) on a mid-mountain range in Germany. We used a combination of trait measurements and a field experiment to assess the relative importance of temperature, trait adaptations, and biotic interactions on elevational limits. 

Results indicate that concurrent seedling emergence, low frost resistance and, for I. glandulifera, late flowering, are important contributors to elevational limits. Because of a lack of seed bank persistence, erratic spring and autumn frost events coinciding with the plants' annual life-cycles will likely influence the upper limits of the invasive species. The abundance of the species seems to be further limited by herbivory, mainly by molluscs. 

Given that a highly nuanced interaction between phenological development and erratic frost events are important for range limits, predictions based solely on mean climatic values, such as temperature, are unlikely to accurately predict future invasion limits. 

Our results indicate that occasional occurrences of the species do not necessarily call for eradication actions, that management efforts might be most effective at intermediate elevations, and that any measure encouraging terrestrial molluscs will help to maintain biotic resistance.","School of Computing, Electronics and Maths"

They are well understood at a fundamental level through the renormalization group. They have been verified in multitudes of theoretical, computational and experimental studies and are firmly established and profoundly important for our understanding of critical phenomena. One of the scaling relations, hyperscaling, fails above the upper critical dimension. There, critical phenomena are governed by Gaussian fixed points in the renormalization-group formalism. Dangerous irrelevant variables are required to deliver the mean-field and Landau values of the critical exponents, which are deemed valid by the Ginzburg criterion. Also above the upper critical dimension, the standard picture is that, unlike for low-dimensional systems, finite-size scaling is non-universal, at least at the critical point. Here we report on new developments which indicate that the current paradigm is flawed and incomplete. In particular, the introduction of a new exponent characterising the finite-size correlation length allows one to extend hyperscaling beyond the upper critical dimension. Moreover, finite-size scaling is shown to be universal provided the correct scaling window is chosen. These recent developments above the upper critical dimension also lead to the introduction of a new scaling relation analogous to one introduced by Fisher 50 years ago and deliver a statistical physics explanation for the emergence of effective four dimensionality as characteristic of generic field theories.","School of Computing, Electronics and Maths"

In this article, we also propose a technique to eliminate this requirement. These approaches are applied to several sets of mixed neutron and gamma-ray pulses obtained through different digitizers using stilbene scintillator in order to analyze them and measure their discrimination quality.","School of Computing, Electronics and Maths"

However, it is an integer programming problem and as well as a NP-hard problem to find optimal solutions within polynomial time.

Axially symmetric disturbances are considered in the inductionless approximation corresponding to zero magnetic Prandtl number. Axial symmetry allows us to reveal an entirely new electromagnetic instability. First, we show that the electric current passing through the liquid can extend the range of helical magnetorotational instability (HMRI) indefinitely by transforming it into a purely electromagnetic instability. Two different electromagnetic instability mechanisms are identified. The first is an internal pinch-type instability, which is due to the interaction of the electric current with its own magnetic field. Axisymmetric mode of this instability requires a free-space component of the azimuthal magnetic field. When the azimuthal component of the magnetic field is purely rotational and the axial component is nonzero, a new kind of electromagnetic instability emerges. The latter, driven by the interaction of electric current with a weak collinear magnetic field in a quiescent fluid, gives rise to a steady meridional circulation coupled with azimuthal rotation.

Filling this gap is one of the main aims of the Games and Learning Alliance (http://www.galanoe.eu) European Network of Excellence on Serious Games, which has a focus upon pedagogy-driven SGs. This paper relies on the assumption that the fundamental aspect of SG design consists in the translation of learning goals/practices into mechanical element of gameplay, serving to an instructional purpose beside that of play and fun. This paper proposes the Learning Mechanics-Game Mechanics (LM-GM) model, which supports SG analysis and design by allowing reflection on the various pedagogical and game elements in an SG. The LM-GM model includes a set of pre-defined game mechanics and pedagogical elements that we have abstracted from literature on game studies and learning theories. Designers and analysts can exploit these mechanics to draw the LM-GM map for a game, so as to identify and highlight its main pedagogical and entertainment features, and their interrelations. The tool may also be useful for teachers to evaluate the effectiveness of a given game and better understand how to implement it in educational settings. A case study is reported to illustrate the framework's support in determining how gameplay and pedagogy intertwine in an SG.

We first derive a laminar solution for the inviscid equations of motion under the assumption of uniform vorticity flow. This solution exhibits a res- onance if the libration frequency matches the frequency of the spin-over inertial mode. Furthermore, we extend our model by introducing a reduced model of the effect of viscous Ekman layers in the limit of low Ekman number (Noir and C\'ebron 2013). This theoretical approach is consistent with the results of Chan et al. (2011) and Zhang et al. (2012) for spheroidal geometries. Our results are validated against systematic three-dimensional numerical simulations. In the second part of the paper, we present the first linear sta- bility analysis of this uniform vorticity flow. To this end, we adopt different methods (Lifschitz and Hameiri 1991; Gledzer and Ponomarev 1977) that allow to deduce upper and lower bounds for the growth rate of an instability. Our analysis shows that the uniform vorticity base flow is prone to inertial instabilities caused by a parametric resonance mechanism. This is confirmed by a set of direct numerical simulations. Applying our results to planetary settings, we find that neither a spin-over resonance nor an inertial instability can exist within the liquid core of the Moon, Io and Mercury.","School of Computing, Electronics and Maths"

The performance of the IWC algorithm, both in terms of classification accuracy and training time, is compared with other commonly used classification algorithms.

The authors contend that the effects of lying, misunderstanding, humour and lack of shared knowledge during human-machine and human-human interactions can provide an impetus to building better conversational agents increasingly deployed as virtual customer service agents. Applying the findings could improve human-robot interaction, for example as conversational companions for the elderly or unwell. But do we always want these agents to talk like humans do?

algorithm is proposed to enhance both delay and throughput performance of the IEEE 802.11 distributed

to deal with unsaturated traffic load conditions. In particular, the equilibrium point analysis model is used

It describes a model for robot navigation that uses architecture similar to an actor-critic reinforcement learning architecture. It sets up the actor as a layer seconded by another layer which deduce the value function. Therefore, the effect is to have similar to a critic outcome combined with the actor in one network. The model hence can be used as the base for a truly deep reinforcement learning architecture that can be explored in the future. More importantly this work explores the results of mixing conjugate gradient update with gradient update for the mentioned architecture. The reward signal is back propagated from the critic to the actor through conjugate gradient eligibility trace for the second layer combined with gradient eligibility trace for the first layer. We show that this mixture of updates seems to work well for this model. The features layer have been deeply trained by applying a simple PCA on the whole set of images histograms acquired during the first running episode. The model is also able to adapt to a reduced features dimension autonomously. Initial experimental result on real robot shows that the agent accomplished good success rate in reaching a goal location.","School of Computing, Electronics and Maths"

These devices were designed to operate at a resonant frequency of either 870 MHz or 1.5 GHz, employing zinc oxide as the piezoelectric layer and an acoustic mirror made from molybdenum and silicon dioxide layers. Finite element analysis of the acoustic resonators was performed using COMSOL Multiphysics software in order to evaluate the frequency response of the devices and the performance of the acoustic mirror. The zinc oxide based acoustic resonators were fabricated on a silicon substrate using a five mask process. The mass sensitivity of the acoustic resonators was estimated using a 3D finite element model and preliminary testing has been performed. The theoretical and observed mass sensitivity were similar at ca. 145 kHz ng−1 for the 870 MHz resonator when detecting PM2.5 suggesting that SMR devices have potential to be used as part of a miniature smart sensor system for airborne particle detection.","School of Computing, Electronics and Maths"

Engineering resilient system/infrastructure is a challenging task, that implies how to measure the resilience and how to obtain sufficient resilience necessary to maintain its service delivery under diverse situations. This paper has two fold objective, the first is to propose a formal approach to measure cyber resilience from different aspects (i.e., attacks, failures) and at different levels (i.e., pro-active, resistive and reactive). To achieve the first objective, we propose a formal framework named as: Cyber Resilience Engineering Framework (CREF). The second objective is to build a resilient system by construction. The idea is to build a formal model of a cyber system, which is initially not resilient with respect to attacks. Then by systematic refinements of the formal model and by its model checking, we attain resiliency.

We present a detailed finite-size scaling analysis of the ferromagnetic-paramagnetic and spin glass-paramagnetic transition lines, and we also discuss the ferromagnetic-spin glass transition regime. We conclude that the present model shares the same universality classes with the isotropic model, but at the symmetric point has a considerably higher transition temperature from the spin-glass state to the paramagnetic phase.

While students showed much interest in ecological issues there was much lower awareness of impacts of the use of appliances, and no observed energy-saving action by students. Thus, while attitudes supporting behaviour change appear to be in place, this is not yet translating into action. Drawing on Social Practice Theory (SPT, Shove et al, 2012), we propose that this is to do with absence of salience (energy use is not the key focus of student activity), together with absence of licence (students appear not to feel they are permitted).

But, due to high velocity and irrelevant information propagation, there may be a performance degradation in some part of the network with respect to these parameters. To address these issues, we have designed novel algorithms for context-aware information propagation among the vehicles. The proposed scheme consists of algorithms for data access, data dissemination, and data suggestion. These algorithms are based on reliability of vehicle which is calculated as soon as vehicles enter the network and is updated after each successful execution of various operations of information propagation. The scheme works on by increasing the reliability which in turn solve the broadcast storm problem in which sometime irrelevant information may also be sent to the vehicles.

With a prevalence rate as high as 80% (EPRC, 2009), IPV ravages communities in the developing world not only by having harmful health impacts on victims (mostly women), but also by imposing financial costs on already impoverished populations of such countries (EPRC, 2009; Olayanju et al., 2013)., However, for governments and other relevant stakeholders to act and prevent this malaise, there is a need to have better understanding of the costs it imposes on the society (i.e., an estimation of the costs it imposes on individuals in the various communities). This will help appropriate the right amount of resources needed to address the problem. Nevertheless, most developing countries, especially those in Africa, are yet to robustly explore these financial/costs impacts (Duvvury et al., 2004; WHO, 2010). To contribute towards bridging this chasm in knowledge, this paper is based on a cross-sectional population-based survey and explores the costs of IPV in a developing country, Nigeria, via a bottom-up approach (i.e., estimating costs across households). Using a pre-tested questionnaire to solicit appropriate data, a dataset of 719 Nigerian households was collected. This was explored with accounting and economics methodologies such as unit cost analysis, household production and human capital approaches.,The resultant findings indicate that IPV is a major drain on household finances. It imposes an average unit cost per incident of ₦16,465.66 (approximately, $83 US Dollars) on each household, despite the fact that large proportions of the country (approximately 100 million people) live on less than $1 US Dollar per day. The findings from this study provide a strong indication of the need for an urgent preventive action on IPV, so as to save lives and rescue people (both current and future generations) from poverty, in addition to reducing all other debilitating health, psychological and social effects resulting from it.","School of Computing, Electronics and Maths,School of Strategy and Leadership"

In this paper, we propose a topic community-based method via nonnegative matrix factorization (NMF). This method first applies joint NMF model to mine topic community existing in OSN by combing link and content information. Then it makes friend recommendation based on topic community. Experiments show that our method can reflect user preferences on friend selection more appropriately and has better recommendation performance than traditional methods. Moreover, our application case also demonstrates that it can obviously improve friend recommendation service in the real world OSN.

In this paper, experiments are discussed which help to evaluate the effectiveness of the iML-“human-in-the-loop” approach, particularly in opening the “black box”, thereby enabling a human to directly and indirectly manipulating and interacting with an algorithm.

Meanwhile, a semantic information services management platform is introduced for the advertisement, matchmaking and retrieval of semantic information services. Some relevant techniques used to build the framework are introduced extensively. A demonstration case study on waste LCD TV is used to illustrate the effectiveness and significance of the proposed framework.","School of Computing, Electronics and Maths"

Traditional search methods are difficult to extend to MOO problems so many of these problems are solved using bio-inspired optimization algorithms. One of the famous optimization algorithms that have been applied to MOO is the nondominated sorting genetic algorithm II (NSGA-II). NSGA-II algorithm has been successfully used to solve MOO problems owing to its lower computational complexity compared with the other optimization algorithms. In this paper we use NSGA-II to solve a MOO problem of time series data mining. The problem in question is determining the optimal weights of a multi-metric distance that is used to perform several data mining tasks. NSGA-II is particularly appropriate to optimize data mining problems where fitness functions evaluation usually involves intensive computing resources. Whereas several previous papers have proposed different methods to optimize time series data mining problems, this paper is, to our knowledge, the first paper to optimize several time series data mining tasks simultaneously. The experiments we conducted show that the performance of the optimized combination of multi-metric distances we propose in executing time series data mining tasks is superior to that of the distance metrics that constitute the combination when they are applied separately.","School of Computing, Electronics and Maths"

In particular the issue in question is the importance of human judges interrogating in practical Turing tests. As supportive evidence for this we make use of transcripts which originated from a series of practical Turing’s tests held 6–7 June 2014 at the Royal Society London. Each of the tests involved a 3-participant simultaneous comparison by a judge of two hidden entities, one being a human and the other a machine. Thirty different judges took part in total. Each of the transcripts considered in the paper resulted in a judge being unable to say for certain which was the machine and which was the human. The main point we consider here is the fallibility of humans in deciding whether they are conversing with a machine or a human; hence we are concerned specifically with the decision-making process.","School of Computing, Electronics and Maths"

Our results suggest that selectivity is related to constraints that potential ligands encounter on their way from the surface of the protein to their final position at the pocket bottom. Tomographic docking helps develop specific hypotheses about ligand binding, distinguishing binders from non-binders, and suggests that binding is a three-step mechanism, consisting of engagement with a niche in the back wall of the pocket, interaction with a molecular filter which allows or precludes further descent of ligands, and binding on the pocket base. Only molecules that are able to descend the pocket and bind at its base allow the co-receptor IAA7 to bind on the complex, thus behaving as active auxins. Analyzing the interactions at different depths, our new method helps in identifying critical residues that constitute preferred future study targets and in the quest for safe and effective herbicides. Also, it has the potential to extend the utility of docking from ligand searches to the study of processes contributing to selectivity.","School of Computing, Electronics and Maths"

authors proved this for the factor in the complexity bound dependent on
the number of polynomials in the input. However, the other term, that

Here, we present data on the phenology and yield of winter rye in western Poland collected between 1957 and 2012 from a long-term field experiment. Data were examined for trends through time and compared to climatological factors using regression analysis. Both annual air temperature and precipitation increased during the study period, equivalent to 2 °C and 186 mm, respectively, over the 52-year period for which met data were available. We detected significant delays in sowing date and recently in emergence, but significant advances were apparent in full flowering date equivalent to 4 days/decade. Yield and plant density experienced a step like change in 1986; yield increasing by ca. 70 % and plant density increasing by ca. 50 %, almost coinciding with a similar change in annual mean temperature, but most likely caused by a changed seed rate and use of herbicides. Future climate change is expected to have a greater impact on this crop, but farmers may be able to adapt to these changes by modifying water regimes, using new machinery and sowing new rye varieties.

We determine the detailed schedules for all vehicles to be used during the unloading process and the storage location to be assigned for all containers. A series of experiments are carried out for small-sized problems by using commercial software. A genetic algorithm (GA) is designed for solving large-sized problems. The solutions from the GA for the small-sized problems are compared with the optimal solutions obtained from the commercial software to verify the effectiveness of the GA.

Prade",The Basic Principles of Uncertain Information Fusion. An organized review of merging rules in different representation frameworks,"We propose and advocate basic principles for the fusion of incomplete or uncertain information items, that should apply regardless of the formalism adopted for representing pieces of information coming from several sources. This formalism can be based on sets, logic, partial orders, possibility theory, belief functions or imprecise probabilities. We propose a general notion of information item representing incomplete or uncertain information about the values of an entity of interest. It is supposed to rank such values in terms of relative plausibility, and explicitly point out impossible values. Basic issues affecting the results of the fusion process, such as relative information content and consistency of information items, as well as their mutual consistency, are discussed. For each representation setting, we present fusion rules that obey our principles, and compare them to postulates specific to the representation proposed in the past. In the crudest (Boolean) representation setting (using a set of possible values), we show that the understanding of the set in terms of most plausible values, or in terms of non-impossible ones matters for choosing a relevant fusion rule. Especially, in the latter case our principles justify the method of maximal consistent subsets, while the former is related to the fusion of logical bases. Then we consider several formal settings for incomplete or uncertain information items, where our postulates are instantiated: plausibility orderings, qualitative and quantitative possibility distributions, belief functions and convex sets of probabilities. The aim of this work is to provide a unified picture of fusion rules across various uncertainty representation settings.

At the same time, the taxation information related data is a classic kind of big data. These issues challenge the effectiveness of traditional data mining-based tax evasion detection methods. To address this problem, we first investigate the classic tax evasion cases, and employ a graph-based method to characterize their property that describes two suspicious relationship trails with a same antecedent node behind an Interest-Affiliated Transaction (IAT). Next, we propose a Colored Network-Based Model (CNBM) for characterizing economic behaviors, social relationships, and the IATs between taxpayers, and generating a Taxpayer Interest Interacted Network (TPIIN). To accomplish the tax evasion detection task by discovering suspicious groups in a TPIIN, methods for building a patterns tree and matching component patterns are introduced and the completeness of the methods based on graph theory is presented. Then, we describe an experiment based on real data and a simulated network. The experimental results show that our proposed method greatly improves the efficiency of tax evasion detection, as well as provides a clear explanation of the tax evasion behaviors of taxpayer groups.","School of Computing, Electronics and Maths"

The model was recently introduced to explain discrepancies between theoretical predictions and experimental observations of phase transitions in some systems where the Z q -symmetry is spontaneously broken. We analyse the marginal dimensions of the model, i.e., the value of r at which the order of the phase transition changes. In the q = 2 case, we determine that value to be ${r}_{{\rm{c}}}=3.65(5);$ there is a second-order phase transition there when $r\lt {r}_{{\rm{c}}}$ and a first-order one at $r\gt {r}_{{\rm{c}}}$. We also analyse the region $1\leqslant q\lt 2$ and show that the change from second to first order there is manifest through a new mechanism involving two marginal values of r. The q = 1 limit gives bond percolation. Above the lower value r c1, the order parameters exhibit discontinuities at temperature $\tilde{t}$ below a critical value t c. The larger value r c2 marks the point at which the phase transition at t c changes from second to first order. Thus, for ${r}_{{\rm{c}}1}\lt r\lt {r}_{{\rm{c}}2}$, the transition at t c remains second order while at $\tilde{t}$ the system undergoes a first order phase transition. As r increases further, $\tilde{t}$ increases, bringing the discontinuity closer to t c. Finally, when r exceeds r c2 $\tilde{t}$ coincides with t c and the phase transition becomes first order. This new mechanism indicates how the discontinuity characteristic of first order phase transitions emerges.","School of Computing, Electronics and Maths"

At a decreasing Reynolds number, the bubble accelerations show deviations from that of tracer particles; i.e., they deviate from the Heisenberg-Yaglom prediction and show a quicker decorrelation despite their small size and minute St. Using direct numerical simulations, we show that these effects arise due the drift of these particles through the turbulent flow. We theoretically predict this gravity-driven effect for developed isotropic turbulence, with the ratio of Stokes to Froude number or equivalently the particle drift velocity governing the enhancement of acceleration variance and the reductions in correlation time and intermittency. Our predictions are in good agreement with experimental and numerical results. The present findings are relevant to a range of scenarios encompassing tiny bubbles and droplets that drift through the turbulent oceans and the atmosphere. They also question the common usage of microbubbles and microdroplets as tracers in turbulence research.","School of Computing, Electronics and Maths"

To improve LRR in this regard, we propose a manifold locality constrained low-rank representation framework (MLCLRR) for data representation. By taking the local manifold structure of the data into consideration, the proposed MLCLRR method not only can represent the global low-dimensional structures, but also capture the local intrinsic non-linear geometric information in the data.

To date, these aspects have received only modest attention. In the current study, we examine honeybee and beekeeping activity in southern Poland for the period 1965–2010, supplemented by hive yields from a beekeeper in southern UK in the same period. We show that despite negative reports on honeybee condition, and documented climate change, the studied apiary managed to show a marked increase in honey production over the 46 year study period, as did that from the UK. The proportion of the annual yield originating from the first harvest decreased during the study period and was associated with rising temperatures in summer. Honeybee spring phenology showed strong negative relationships with temperature but no overall change through time because temperatures of key early spring months had not increased significantly. In contrast, increasing yields and an increased number of harvests (and hence a later final harvest and longer season) were detected and were related to rising temperatures in late spring and in summer.

It consists of two separate but related issues: Virtual machine (VM) placement and VM migration problems. In this paper, a VM consolidation scheme is proposed that turns the virtual machine consolidation (VMC) problem into a vector packing optimization problem based on deadlock-free migration (DFM) to minimize the energy consumptions. To solve this NP-hard and computationally infeasible for large data centers problem, a novel algorithm named Chicken Swarm Optimization based on deadlock-free migration (DFM-CSO) algorithm is proposed. The DFM-CSO algorithm is characterized by the ‘one-step look-ahead with n-VMs migration in parallel (OSLA-NVMIP)’ method, which carries out the VM migration validation and the rearrangement of target physical host, as well as records the migration order for each solution placement, so that VM transfer can be completed according to the migration sequence. The experimental results, for both real and synthetic datasets, show that the proposed algorithm with higher convergence rate is favourable in comparison with the other deadlock-free migration algorithms.

We study numerically the density of bridges and the fragmentation kernel, i.e., the relative sizes of the generated fragments, and find that these quantities follow a scaling description. The corresponding scaling exponents are related to well known equilibrium critical exponents of the model. Using the Russo-Margulis formalism, we derive an exact relation between the expected density of bridges and the number of active edges. The same approach allows us to study the fluctuations in the numbers of bridges, thereby uncovering a new singularity in the random- cluster model as q <4 cos2 (π/√3) in two dimensions. For numerical simulations of the model directly in the language of individual bonds, known as Sweeny's algorithm, the prevalence of bridges and the scaling of the sizes of clusters connected by bridges and candidate-bridges play a pivotal role.

The framework is developed using cloud computing services based on Amazon web services (AWS) integrated with geographical information systems (GIS) to facilitate big data capture, storage, index and visualization of data through smart devices for different stakeholders. In order to develop a predictive model for health-shocks, we have collected a unique data from 1000 households, in rural and remotely accessible regions of Pakistan, focusing on factors like health, social, economic, environment and accessibility to healthcare facilities. We have used the collected data to generate a predictive model of health-shock using a fuzzy rule summarization technique, which can provide stakeholders with interpretable linguistic rules to explain the causal factors affecting health-shocks. The evaluation of the proposed system in terms of the interpret-ability and accuracy of the generated data models for classifying health-shock shows promising results. The prediction accuracy of the fuzzy model based on a k-fold cross-validation of the data samples shows above 89% performance in predicting health-shocks based on the given factors.

Bell",Citizen science identifies the effects of nitrogen dioxide and other environmental drivers on tar spot of sycamore,"Elevated sulphur dioxide (SO2) concentrations were the major cause of the absence of symptoms of tar spot (Rhytisma acerinum) of sycamore (Acer pseudoplatanus), in urban areas in the 1970s. The subsequent large decline in SO2 concentrations has not always been accompanied by increased tar spot symptoms, for reasons that have remained unresolved. We used a large citizen science survey, providing over 1000 records across England, to test two competing hypotheses proposed in earlier studies. We were able to demonstrate the validity of both hypotheses; tar spot symptoms were reduced where there were fewer fallen leaves as a source of inoculum, and elevated nitrogen dioxide concentrations reduced tar spot symptoms above a threshold concentration of about 20 μg m−3. Symptom severity was also lower at sites with higher temperature and lower rainfall. Our findings demonstrate the power of citizen science to resolve competing hypotheses about the impacts of air pollution and other environmental drivers.

The objective of this paper is therefore three-fold: firstly, the paper identifies the implicit parameters which are statistically correlated with the user explicit rating through user study 1. These parameters are used to develop a predictive model which can be used to represent users’ perceived relevance of documents. Secondly, it investigates the reliability and validity of the predictive model by comparing it with eye gaze during a reading task through user study 2. Our findings suggest that there is no significant difference between the predictive model based on implicit indicators and eye gaze within the context examined. Thirdly, we measured the consistency of user explicit rating in both studies and found significant consistency in user explicit rating of document relevance and interest level which further validates the predictive model. We envisage that the results presented in this paper can help to develop recommender and personalised systems for recommending documents to users based on their previous interaction with the system.","School of Computing, Electronics and Maths"

Menzel",Can we detect a nonlinear response to temperature in European plant phenology?,"Over a large temperature range, the statistical association between spring phenology and temperature is often regarded and treated as a linear function. There are suggestions that a sigmoidal relationship with definite upper and lower limits to leaf unfolding and flowering onset dates might be more realistic. We utilised European plant phenological records provided by the European phenology database PEP725 and gridded monthly mean temperature data for 1951–2012 calculated from the ENSEMBLES data set E-OBS (version 7.0). We analysed 568,456 observations of ten spring flowering or leafing phenophases derived from 3657 stations in 22 European countries in order to detect possible nonlinear responses to temperature. Linear response rates averaged for all stations ranged between −7.7 (flowering of hazel) and −2.7 days °C−1 (leaf unfolding of beech and oak). A lower sensitivity at the cooler end of the temperature range was detected for most phenophases. However, a similar lower sensitivity at the warmer end was not that evident. For only ∼14 % of the station time series (where a comparison between linear and nonlinear model was possible), nonlinear models described the relationship significantly better than linear models. Although in most cases simple linear models might be still sufficient to predict future changes, this linear relationship between phenology and temperature might not be appropriate when incorporating phenological data of very cold (and possibly very warm) environments. For these cases, extrapolations on the basis of linear models would introduce uncertainty in expected ecosystem changes.","School of Computing, Electronics and Maths"

Low",Classification of Solutions to the Plane Extremal Distance Problem for Bodies With Smooth Boundaries,"The determination of the contact points between two bodies with analytically described boundaries can be viewed as the limiting case of the extremal point problem, where the distance between the bodies is vanishing. The advantage of this approach is that the solutions can be computed efficiently along with the generalized state during time integration of a multibody system by augmenting the equations of motion with the corresponding extremal point conditions. Unfortunately, these solutions can degenerate when one boundary is concave or both boundaries are nonconvex. We present a novel method to derive degeneracy and nondegeneracy conditions that enable the determination of the type and codimension of all the degenerate solutions that can occur in plane contact problems involving two bodies with smooth boundaries. It is shown that only divergence bifurcations are relevant, and thus, we can simplify the analysis of the degeneracy by restricting the system to its one-dimensional center manifold. The resulting expressions are then decomposed by applying the multinomial theorem resulting in a computationally efficient method to compute explicit expressions for the Lyapunov coefficients and transversality conditions. Furthermore, a procedure to analyze the bifurcation behavior qualitatively at such solution points based on the Tschirnhaus transformation is given and demonstrated by examples. The application of these results enables in principle the continuation of all the solutions simultaneously beyond the degeneracy as long as their number is finite.","School of Computing, Electronics and Maths"

Embedded on the web affording round-the-clock interaction the nature of artificial dialogue systems is evolving as these systems learn from the way humans converse.

The detection of the microaneurysms at an early stage is vital, and it is the first step in preventing the diabetic retinopathy. The paper first explores the existing systems and applications related to diabetic retinopathy screening, with a focus on the microaneurysm detection methods. The proposed decision support system consists of an automatic acquisition, screening and classification of diabetic retinopathy colour fundus images, which could assist in the detection and management of the diabetic retinopathy. Several feature extraction methods and the circular Hough transform have been employed in the proposed microaneurysm detection system, alongside the fuzzy histogram equalisation method. The latter method has been applied in the preprocessing stage of the diabetic retinopathy eye fundus images and provided improved results for detecting the microaneurysms.","School of Computing, Electronics and Maths"

However, in realistic e-commerce environments, the review-related data are imbalanced, and this leads to a problem in which minority class information tends to be ignored during the training phase of a classification model. To address this problem, we propose a topic sentence-based instance transfer method to process imbalanced Chinese product reviews by using an auxiliary dataset (source dataset). The proposed method incorporates a rule and supervised learning hybrid approach to identify a topic sentence of each product review and adds the feature set of the topic sentence to the feature space of sentiment classification. Next, to measure the transferability of instances in source dataset, a greedy algorithm based on information gain of top-N common features is used to select common features. Then, a common feature-based cosine similarity of instances between source dataset and target dataset is introduced to select the transferable instances. Furthermore, a synthetic minority over-sampling technique (Smote) based method is adopted to overcome feature space inconsistency between the source dataset and target dataset. Finally, we immigrate the instances selected in source dataset into target dataset to form a new dataset for the training of classification model. Two datasets collected from Jingdong and Dangdang are the target dataset and source dataset. The experimental results verify that, considering the ability of generalization, our proposed method helps a support vector machine (SVM) to outperform other classification methods, such as the J48, Naive Bayes, Random Forest and Random Committee methods, when applied to datasets produced by resampling and Smote.,NOTICE: this is the author’s version of a work that was accepted for publication in Electronic Commerce Research and Applications.

However, it can be expensive, with worst case complexity doubly exponential in the size of the input. Hence it is important to formulate the problem in the best manner for the CAD algorithm. One possibility is to precondition the input polynomials using Groebner Basis (GB) theory. Previous experiments have shown that while this can often be very beneficial to the CAD algorithm, for some problems it can significantly worsen the CAD performance. In the present paper we investigate whether machine learning, specifically a support vector machine (SVM), may be used to identify those CAD problems which benefit from GB preconditioning. We run experiments with over 1000 problems (many times larger than previous studies) and find that the machine learned choice does better than the human-made heuristic.

Even though there is a lack of standard methodologies or formulaic frameworks to better inform game-based intervention development, there exist scientific and empirical studies that can serve as benchmarks for establishing scientific validity in terms of the efficacy of using games to achieve serious outcomes. The development of these games does not normally follow a specific set of guidelines, which limits replication. There is a need to reflect on such a multidisciplinary process and infuse knowledge from relevant disciplines towards developing a unity of considerations and approaches beyond the disciplinary perspectives. An infused and trans-disciplinary methodological framework could serve as a guideline to inform the development process of a game-based approach. With these perspectives, this paper aims to provide an example of how relevant theories and frameworks can be adopted collectively in order to inform a development process. Based on a digital game intervention aiming to support the delivery of Relationships and Sex Education (RSE) in the UK, this paper reflects on trans-disciplinary considerations, informed by frameworks such as the Four-Dimensional Framework (4DF), the Intervention Mapping (IM) approach, Mechanics Dynamics Aesthetics model (MDA) and Learning Mechanics-Game Mechanics (LM-GM) mapping. IM, when infused with the game design considerations of 4DF, provides a more procedural perspective to game-based intervention development, collectively reflecting a participatory development approach. This subsequently provides the basis upon which other theoretical and methodological frameworks such as the MDA and the LM-GM models can be embedded in order to marry the pedagogical aspects with the entertainment attributes of gameplay. These components, when integrated, may formulate a trans-disciplinary model that can be adopted and adapted by other researchers, designers and developers.,Publisher Statement: This is the peer reviewed version of the following article: Kuzu, D 2015, 'The Politics of Identity, Recognition and Multiculturalism: The Kurds in Turkey' British Journal of Educational Technology, vol 48, no. 2, pp. 379-312, which has been published in final form at 10.1111/bjet.12377.

This article builds on previous work defining the properties of cyberspace in terms of vertical layers, which when combined with a representation of distance presents a three-dimensional model. The unique attributes of cyberspace can be harnessed for power projection, the aim of which is ultimately to alter the behaviour of individuals. Although cyberspace has yet to be used as a medium to demonstrate conventional hard power of coercion and threats supported by physical force, it does present a suitable medium for the projection of soft power of attraction and imitation. These are defined within the context of the online environment and by drawing on the techniques used to optimise Web-based commerce, potential methods of implementing and measuring the success of a campaign of cyberpower projection are proposed.

The concept of extending the current practise of incident and investigation record keeping to something akin to an Aeronautical Pilots Logbook: i.e. a record of all matters to do with their flying history. In respect of how that translates in the Digital Investigation realm, a comprehensive record of all elements that might constitute an individual’s record of work and development.  Although the natural environment of debating note taking for digital forensic evidential purposes is legal in nature, the origins of this paper relate less to Law than the processes involved in investigation and are a good deal more fundamental than examining forensic artefacts. They also reflect the concepts of professionalising practise and establishing an understanding of what constitutes evidential sufficiency for the purposes of court proceedings, but how this process can be applied to individual development and progress. By taking the rationale that governs the investigative note taking employed by Senior Investigating Officers (SIOs), investigating the most serious and complex of criminal offences there is an opportunity to enhance current contemporaneous note taking and keeping. The object in so doing is twofold: codify current practices and give them a framework that is consistent and well understood; and secondly, to establish the recorded decision making processes to make the auditing of an investigation a much more transparent, obvious and sequential process. Inevitably, there is a need to consider the legal aspects of how note taking has relevance to proceedings and whilst the paper refers to Association of Chief Officers (ACPO) Principles regarding Digital Evidence, the universal application of these concepts should be understood.","School of Computing, Electronics and Maths"

While such approaches are quite successful, they are not particularly well suited for parallelization as the chain dynamics is sequential, and if replicated chains are used to increase statistics each of them relaxes into equilibrium with an intrinsic time constant that cannot be reduced by parallel work. Population annealing is a sequential Monte Carlo method that simulates an ensemble of system replica under a cooling protocol. The population element makes it naturally well suited for massively parallel simulations, and bias can be systematically reduced by increasing the population size. We present an implementation of population annealing on graphics processing units and discuss its behavior for different systems undergoing continuous and first-order phase transitions.","School of Computing, Electronics and Maths"

Receiver Directed Transmission protocol (RDT) is designed to provide multichannel access using a single radio interface. RDT introduces a clever approach to support channel assignment and negotiation without relying on a control channel or time synchronisation. Protocols based on the RDT scheme normally use an extra radio interface, dual home channel or time synchronisation to overcome the expected issues in RDT, such as, hidden terminal and deafness problems. This paper demonstrates that using RDT with a single radio and single home channel it is still possible to increase the network capacity. Additionally, the paper investigates the effect of node density, mobility and number of available channels on RDT performance. NS-2 simulator is used to evaluate the proposed scheme. Simulation results confirm that using multichannel RDT scheme can effectively increase the throughput, the packet delivery ratio and reduce the delay compared to single channel protocol.","School of Computing, Electronics and Maths"

Chiu, Jacek Lewandowski, Kuo-Ming Chao",Parallel dynamic data-driven model for concept drift detection and prediction,"The traditional data analysis and prediction method assumes that data distribution is normal and will not change. Therefore, it can predict unlabeled data by analyzing the static and historical data. However, in today’s big-data environment, which is changing frequently, the traditional approaches can no longer be effective, as they cannot handle concept drift problems in a Dynamic Data Driven Application System (DDDAS). This study proposes a parallel detection and prediction method for concept drift problems in DDDAS. The proposed method can detect dynamic and changing data, and then feedback to the prediction model to revise for better subsequent predictions. Furthermore, this method computes a global prediction result by aggregating local predictions in the resource bounded environment. Therefore, the prediction accuracy increases, and the computation time decreases. In the simulation, the Map-Reduce technology is used for parallel processing. The simulation results show that the prediction accuracy is raised by 14%, and the execution time is improved by almost 45%.

These applications require a reconfigurable sensor architecture that can span multiple scenarios, devices and use cases that allow storage, networking and computational resources to be efficiently used on the edge of the network. There are a number of platforms and gateway architectures that have been proposed to manage these components and enable application deployment. These approaches lack horizontal integration between multiple providers as well as higher order functionalities like load balancing and clustering. This is partly due to the strongly coupled nature of the deployed applications, a lack of abstraction of device communication layers as well as a lock-in for communication protocols. This limitation is a major obstacle for the development of a protocol agnostic application environment that allows for single application to be migrated and to work with multiple peripheral devices with varying protocols from different local gateways. This research looks at existing platforms and their shortcomings as well as proposes a messaging based modular gateway platform that enables clustering of gateways and the abstraction of peripheral communication protocol details. These novelties allow applications to send and receive messages regardless of their deployment location and destination device protocol, creating a more uniform development environment. Furthermore, it results in a more streamlined application development and testing while providing more efficient use of the gateway’s resources. Our evaluation of a prototype for the system shows the need for the migration of resources and the QoS advantages of such a system.

Furthermore, the parameters in the EETM are further enhanced to be self-adaptive to ensure the geometric validity of the encrypted model.

However, the standard reasoning and impact accumulation mechanisms developed for RBFCMs assume that the level of variation that a fuzzy set represents is directly linked with the shape of the fuzzy set. It poses a big restriction on how the corresponding fuzzy sets have to be constructed. In this paper we propose a new reasoning and impact accumulation mechanisms which take into consideration standard semantics of fuzzy sets, where their uncertainty is measured by fuzziness. New type of complex fuzzy relationships and reasoning on them is introduced to model a joint impact of several causal nodes on one effect node. With these new mechanisms, RBFCMs become much more flexible, provide more means to capture complexity of real world systems and are less computational demanding than standard mechanisms.

The results obtained from this study are encouraging as low False Accept Rates (FAR) and False Reject Rates (FRR) were achieved in the experimentation phase.

Organisations will have a mandatory obligation to report breaches of personal data, and will face fines of up to 4% of global turnover – or €20 million (approximately £17.3 million) – whichever is the greater. Victims of personal data breach will have the right to judicial remedy, and compensation limits are uncapped. Faced with such deterrents, organisations will need to ensure they are fully ready for the GDPR’s arrival, yet they now have less than 12 months to become compliant. In data protection terms, this is a seismic event. This paper aims to examine corporate GDPR readiness, with focus on how,digital forensic process can help with data breach investigations, mindful that organisations may be less able to defend themselves in legal proceedings if the evidence they present has not been acquired reliably. For the purposes of this research, scope was limited to organisations in the UK, to avoid complications of legal jurisdiction and sovereignty boundaries, and because of topical uncertainty caused by the UK’s 2016 referendum decision to leave the EU. The author’s previous experience in corporate IT environments led to a natural curiosity of how well IT departments are preparing for the GDPR. Research was quantitative in,nature and adopted the critical research method. Primary research included an online survey, completed anonymously by 145 IT workers, which aimed to gauge organisations’ levels of maturity regarding data protection and forensic investigation. Results were critically analysed and compared to existing research where available, and to the author’s own theoretical assumptions.

See, Arfan Ghani, Akram Bati, Peter Thiemann",Direct flux control – sensorless control method of PMSM for all speeds – basics and constraints,"magnet synchronous machines and proposes a viable solution. The main concept of sensorless control of drives relies on additional information given by the machine during its normal operation. This information provided by the machine is essentially the Back Electro Motive Force and the variance of the stator inductivity, which are dependent on the rotor position. Several approaches and methods have discussed these problems and in most cases, they are not avoidable and that some methods work better on certain speeds of the drives. This paper presents the Direct Flux Control method to combat the above problems at all speeds. The flux linkage signal which contains the necessary information about the rotor position, can be measured between the neutral point of a permanent magnet synchronous machine and an artificial one. The mathematical derivation and the observations from the experiments show that this signal contains a second and a forth harmonic, which can be used to calculate the rotor position. Furthermore, the limitations of implementing Direct Flux Control are also addressed.","School of Computing, Electronics and Maths"

Previous studies have focused specifically on the technical aspects of free-throw shooting (Goosey-Tolfrey, Butterworth, & Morriss, 2002; Malone, Gervais, & Steadward, 2002) with limited research exploring the technical and tactical components of field-goal shooting (Francis, Owen, Molnar, & Peters, 2016). Francis et al.’s (2016) work explored the technical and tactical factors affecting two-point and three-point shooting in the 2015 men’s European Wheelchair Basketball Championships, identifying shot movement and shot positioning as being significantly related to shot outcome (successful versus unsuccessful; p < 0.001). This study explores the key determinants of two-point and three-point shooting across two major tournaments and develops a valid prediction model. Following ethical approval, footage of each two-point and three-point shot taken by the top five teams (30 games; 2432 shots) at the 2016 Paralympic Games was analysed in SportsCode (version 10, SportsTec Ltd) using the same performance analysis template and combined with the shooting data from the 2015 European Wheelchair Basketball Championships (nine games; 1144 shots; Francis et al, 2016) to provide data for 3576 shots. Chi-square tests highlighted eleven categorical variables that were significantly associated with shot outcome (p<0.001). The most significant categorical variable was the ‘zone’ in which the shot was taken. A binary logistic regression model was developed to assess the impact of these categorical variables as predictors of the probability of shooting success, using the forward selection method with 70% of the sample (2,499 shots). The final model included thirteen statistically significant predictors and when tested against the remaining 30% of the data an area under the curve (AUC) value of 0.667 was achieved. The model demonstrated that the odds of a shot with similar characteristics being successful were approximately 1.2 times higher in the Paralympics compared to the European Championships (p < 0.05; Odds Ratio: 1.23) as teams at the Paralympics used different defensive systems to apply pressure. These findings support the previous model (Francis et al. 2016) and re-emphasize the importance of shot movement and shot positioning (p < 0.001) as key predictors of shot success. In addition, the new model highlights the odds of achieving a successful shot are increased when the shot is either taken early or late in the shot clock (Odds Ratios of seconds remaining in the shot clock: 0-6 seconds: 2.06; 7-12 seconds: 1.25; 13-17 seconds: 1.45; 18-24 seconds: 1.84). The information gained from this model could be used by coaches and support staff to provide technical and tactical feedback to enhance performance. During training sessions coaches can attempt to ensure players are taking shots in a square to basket position (Odds Ratio: 2.06) or can use the information to recreate shooting situations in order to work on areas of weakness to increase the players odds of success over time.","School of Computing, Electronics and Maths"

Differences in outcome between people aged 75+ who have a managed personal budget or a direct payment,"Direct payments – cash for people eligible for adult social care and spent by them on care and support – are claimed to enable care to better reflect user preferences and goals which improve outcomes. This paper compares outcomes of older direct payment users and those receiving care via a managed personal budget (where the budget is spent on the recipients behalf by a third party). The study adopted a retrospective, comparative design using a postal questionnaire in three English councils with adult social care responsibilities in 2012–13. Included in the study were 1,341 budget users aged 75+, living in ordinary community settings. The overall response rate was 27.1 per cent (339 respondents). Three validated scales measured outcomes: EQ-5D-3L (health status), the Sheldon–Cohen Perceived Stress Scale and the Adult Social Care Outcomes Toolkit (social care-related quality of life). The study found that direct payment users appreciated the control conferred by budget ownership, but in practice, for many it did not ‘translate’ into improved living arrangements. It also found no statistically significant difference in outcomes between direct payment and managed personal budget users. The paper argues that despite policy and other guidance and research evidence about effective implementation of direct payments for older people, the absence of evidence for better outcomes may at least in part be attributable to values underpinning policies relating to personalisation and personal budgets.","School of Computing, Electronics and Maths"

This paper proposes a detection system based on extracting histogram features. The features are extracted by exploiting the histogram of difference image, which is usually a generalised Gaussian distribution centred at 0. The histogram of difference image and the renormal- ized histogram are created for clean and stego images, therefore using the peak value and renormalized histogram as features for classification. To obtain the difference between neighbouring pixels, the difference images are computed for four directions (vertical, hor- izontal, diagonal, and anti-diagonal). The renormalized histogram of the difference im- age is created a number of times (n) for the four directions. This work implements two commonly-used steganography methods: the Least Significant Bit (LSB) and F5 al- gorithm to create a large database of stego images for system evaluation. Colour and grey images with different formats are chosen for training and testing the system. These formats are lossless and lossy compressions, with all features extracted from each colour channel (RGB) separately. The size of hidden files plays an important role in terms of detection. Therefore, to improve the proposed systems detection capacity, different sizes of hidden files have been considered. The proposed detection system was trained and tested to distinguish stego images from clean ones using the Discriminant Analysis (DA) classification method and Multilayer Perceptron neural network (MLP). The ex- perimental results prove that the proposed system possesses reliable detection ability and accuracy. The chosen classification methods show dissimilar performance in terms of classifying grey and colour images. The system holds more generalisability than previous systems by covering different types of stego images, image formats and hidden file sizes. In addition, extensive experimental results show that the proposed steganalysis system outperforms some previous detection methods.","School of Computing, Electronics and Maths"

The diffusivity is directly related to a number of parameters, including the ambient temperature, which varies slowly over time. While molecular noise models have received significant attention, channel fading has not been extensively considered. Using experimental data, we show that the ambient temperature varies approximately according to a normal distribution. As a result, we analytically derive the fading distribution and validate it using numerical simulations. We further derive the joint distribution of the channel gain and the additive noise, and examine the impact of such interactions on the ISI distribution, which is shown to conform to a generalized extreme value distribution.","School of Computing, Electronics and Maths"

A small-scale online survey with closed and semi-structured questions has been deployed to school and university teachers (n=68) for eliciting their experiences in multimodal teaching and learning. Thematic analysis has been adopted as the overarching methodology for reporting patterns in the data from the survey. The results from the analysis showed that experiences of multimodality are discerned as: (1) imparting information, (2) enacting collaborative learning and (3) pre-paring students for exploring concepts.

At its early stage this project focuses on the analysis of different design concepts and operation principles of such intra vaginal sensor device. Traditional methods of intra-vaginal pH sampling, which rely on analysis of vaginal secretions or discharge from lateral vaginal walls, are difficult in long-term and often fraught with the potential for errors. Therefore this paper focuses on the analysis of such sensor's shape, form, size and fabric in order to enable precise, continuous acquisition of females' and animals' intra-vaginal pH and temperature at the right place inside the vagina. The aim is to set such operation principles, which will enable convenient collection and analysis of continuous vaginal pH and temperature samples for the purpose of further study. The objective is to achieve at least as accurate results as with the discrete analysis of clinicallyobtained intra-vaginal specimens, if not better. The data obtained with such sensors could enable a development of insemination prediction and gynaecological disorders detection models, which deployed to, for example smartphone devices, will help to attain high conception rate for animals and eventually improve the control of the vaginal health for women.

Current code-focused information retrieval systems such as Google Code Search, Codeplex or Koders produce results based on specific keywords. However, these systems do not take into account developers’ context such as development language, technology framework, goal of the project, project complexity and developer’s domain expertise. They also impose additional cognitive burden on users in switching between different interfaces and clicking through to find the relevant code. Hence, they are not used by software developers. In this paper, we discuss how software engineers interact with information and general-purpose information retrieval systems (e.g. Google, Yahoo!) and investigate to what extent domain-specific search and recommendation utilities can be developed in order to support their work-related activities. In order to investigate this, we conducted a user study and found that software engineers followed many identifiable and repeatable work tasks and behaviours. These behaviours can be used to develop implicit relevance feedback-based systems based on the observed retention actions. Moreover, we discuss the implications for the development of task-specific search and collaborative recommendation utilities embedded with the Google standard search engine and Microsoft IntelliSense for retrieval and re-engineering of code. Based on implicit relevance feedback, we have implemented a prototype of the proposed collaborative recommendation system, which was evaluated in a controlled environment simulating the real-world situation of professional software engineers. The evaluation has achieved promising initial results on the precision and recall performance of the system.

Unlike past magnetohydrodynamic setups involving a shallow confinement, the experiment presented here drives turbulence whose dimensionality can be set anywhere between three-dimensional and quasi two-dimensional. In particular, we show that the dimensionality and componentality of the turbulence thus generated are in fact completely fixed by the single parameter  lz(li)/hlz(li)/h , which quantifies the competition between the solenoidal component of the Lorentz force and inertia acting on a turbulent structure of the size of the forcing scale  lili . This parameter is fully tunable thanks to the three operating settings at hand: the injection scale, the intensity of the electric forcing and the magnitude of the magnetic field. Thanks to the very high number of measuring probes and fast acquisition rate implemented in this experiment, it is possible to reliably measure the finest features of the inertial range on a scale-wise basis.,Publisher Statement: The final publication is available at Springer via http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00348-017-2363-5 ","School of Computing, Electronics and Maths"

The situation for multiterminal HVdc (MTDC) systems is worse. The characteristics of superconducting material are ideal to limit the fault current in HVdc systems. This paper presents a novel use of the resistive type of superconducting fault current limiter (SFCL) in the MTdc network with the function of limiting the high current. The working principles of fault current limiter and a three-terminal HVdc system are modeled in detail using PSCAD/EMTDC software. The hybrid operation of the SFCL in the three-terminal HVdc system is tested in this paper for the fault response of the MTdc system. The performances of SFCL under different fault conditions are analyzed. The simulation results show that the fault current is effectively restrained and the SFCL can act as an efficient protective device for VSC-based multiterminal HVdc systems.,"School of Computing, Electronics and Maths"

The author concluded that a lot of Nigerian students struggle with the right perception of plagiarism and in most cases, do not understand the long-term consequences, besides the implementation of a holistic approach at managing student plagiarism, the higher institutions need to monitor and evaluate results and adapt measures to the institutional context. Also, there is a need for overseas universities to adjust their management framework in a way that will cater for international students.

The integration of appropriate thermal energy storage system and selection of suitable PCMs plays a very dominating role in the upgrading of energy efficiency. Short and long term storage helps in the reduction of energy demand or shifting peak load for both heating and cooling. However, a comprehensive study for the application of these technologies adopting Chinese built environment is lacking which can relate to climate, energy storage and energy efficiency. The goal of this paper is to provide coherent picture of current status on PCM-based techniques that have been studied with the focus of application in China and analyse the selection and suitability of PCMs and techniques in Chinese regions.

This requires designing a scheduler which assigns data chunks to compute units proportional to their throughputs. For FPGA-CPU heterogeneous devices, to provide the best possible overall throughput, a scheduler should accurately evaluate the different performance behaviour of the compute devices. In this article, we propose a scheduler which initially detects the highest throughput each device can obtain for a specific application with negligible overhead and then partitions the dataset for improved performance. To demonstrate the efficiency of this method, we choose a Zynq UltraScale+ ZCU102 device as the hardware target and parallelise four applications showing that the developed scheduler can provide up to 94.06% of the throughput achievable at an ideal condition, with comparable power and energy consumption.","School of Computing, Electronics and Maths"

Recently, a small number of manufacturers have claimed the successful development of such devices. Panasonic and Transphorm among a few others have also made their devices available in the open market. The commercial availability of these devices, (something common only for mature technologies),,proves the remarkable progress that has been achieved. In this paper, a comprehensive and experimentally derived comparison of the static performance is made between the 600 V Panasonic PGA26C09DV Gate Injected Transistor (GIT) and the 600 V Transphorm cascode TO-220 series devices. The Si 650 V Infineon SPA15N60C3 Super-Junction (S-J) provides a reference with Si technology. The Panasonic devices feature a p-GaN layer which makes them one of the first Enhancement mode (E-mode) GaN power devices on the market, whereas the Transphorm devices are Depletion-mode (D-mode) High Electron Mobility Transistors (HEMTs) cascaded with a low voltage (LV) Si Metal Oxide Semiconductor Field Effect Transistor (MOSFET). Despite the Panasonic and Transphorm devices being examples of GaN-on-Si aiming for the same applications, the measurements and analysis shows that their performance is very different.

Triboelectric energy harvester converts mechanical vibrations into electrical energy via a phenomenon known as ‘triboelectric effect’ which is a type of contact electrification whereby certain materials become electrically charged when they come into fricative contact with different material. An experimental triboelectric energy harvester has been implemented via a material format of polyimide-aluminium bonded with conductive aluminium material using pressure sensitive adhesive. The measured results have been critically evaluated and compared  with  the theoretical model.

An analysis of the scaling of the correlation length as well as the susceptibility and specific heat reveals that it belongs to the universality class of the Ising model with additional logarithmic corrections observed for the Ising model itself if coupled to weak disorder. While the leading scaling behavior in the disordered system is therefore identical between the second-order and first-order segments of the phase diagram of the pure model, the finite-size scaling in the ex-first-order regime is affected by strong transient effects with a crossover length scale $L^{\ast} \approx 32$ for the chosen parameters.","School of Computing, Electronics and Maths"

In order to develop green transportation system, it becomes imperative to use integrated technologies to achieve reduced emissions and utilize renewable energy. Electric vehicles (EVs) have been considered as one of these technologies to transform the traditional vehicle mix. However, the uptake of EV has been debated on factors like cost, performance (autonomous mileage), charging point infrastructure construction, energy saving, policy and end users’ adaptation. Present study investigates the technology feasibility (which usually refer to EVs’ cost, EV charging, supplier’s customer services quality, EV travel performance) and users’ adaptation of EV in Beijing, which is a key driver for the EV uptake into the Beijing transportation system. The relevant data have been collected and analyzed in the form of questionnaire survey around all of these factors. While considering the user perception and satisfaction, safety of charging and energy bills have also been investigated. According to the data analysis, it has been found the policy of ‘No traffic restrictions for EVs’ (the traffic restrictions means for certain date, from Monday to Friday the motor vehicles with the last register number of 1 and 6, 2 and 7, 3 and 8, 4 and 9, 5 and 0, are restricted to travel, respectively), the availability of the charging infrastructure and technical support are the most significant factors affecting the users’ opinions on using EVs.","School of Computing, Electronics and Maths,School of Energy, Construction and Environment"

Spectrum hole is a 3-dimensional concept, where space, time and frequency are involved. By estimating the probable distance, time and frequency of primary user and applying transmit power control to the CR node, we can maximize the spectrum efficiency. Since in D2D (Device to Device) communication, the distance of communication is shorter and the propagation delays can be estimated, we can perform very accurate transmit power control. Using a 3-dimensional spectrum detector to detect spectrum holes in space, time and frequency will yield higher spectrum efficiency because it enhances the degrees of freedom from 1 to 3 and, hence, provides flexibility to use resources with lowest probability of interference.","School of Mechanical, Aerospace and Automotive Engineering,School of Computing, Electronics and Maths"

These relationships have begun to be explored through the concept of inequalities in child welfare, in parallel to the established fields of inequalities in education and health. This article focuses on the relationship between economic inequality and out-of-home care and child protection interventions. The work scales up a pilot study in the West Midlands to an all-England sample, representative of English regions and different levels of deprivation at a local authority (LA) level. The analysis evidences a strong relationship between deprivation and intervention rates and large inequalities between ethnic categories. There is further evidence of the inverse intervention law (Bywaters et al., 2015): for any given level of neighbourhood deprivation, higher rates of child welfare interventions are found in LAs which are less deprived overall. These patterns are taking place in the context of cuts in spending on English children’s services between 2010-11 and 2014-15 that have been greatest in more deprived LAs. Implications for policy and practice to reduce such inequalities are suggested.","School of Computing, Electronics and Maths"

If a Bayes classifier is to be used, then reduction to a dimensionality of $K-1$ is necessary and sufficient to preserve the classification information in the original feature space for the $K$-class problem. However, most of the existing algorithms provide no optimal dimensionality to which to reduce the data, thus classification information can be lost in the reduced space if $K-1$ dimensions are used. In this paper, we present a novel LDR technique to reduce the dimensionality of the original data to $K-1$, such that it is well-primed for Bayesian classification. This is done by sequentially constructing linear classifiers that minimise the Bayes error via a gradient descent procedure, under an assumption of normality. We experimentally validate the proposed algorithm on $10$ UCI datasets. Our algorithm is shown to be superior in terms of the classification accuracy when compared to existing algorithms including LDR based on Fisher's criterion and the Chernoff criterion. The applicability of our algorithm is then demonstrated by employing it in diagnosing the health states of $2$ ultrasonic flow meters. As with the UCI datasets, the proposed algorithm is found to have superior performance to the existing algorithms, achieving classification accuracies of $99.4\%$ and $97.5\%$ on the two flow meters. Such high classification accuracies on the flow meters promise significant cost benefits in oil and gas operations.,NOTICE: this is the author’s version of a work that was accepted for publication in Expert Systems with Applications.

Existing NMF-based methods for community discovery often factorize the corresponding adjacent matrix of complex networks to obtain its community indicator matrix. However, the adjacent matrix cannot represent the global structure feature of complex networks very well, and this leads to the performance degradation of community discovery. Besides, most of existing methods are not robust and scalable enough, so they are not effective to deal with complex networks with noises and large-scales. Aiming at these problems above, in this paper we propose a method for community discovery using distributed robust NMF with SimRank similarity measure. This method selects SimRank measure to construct the feature matrix, which can more accurately represent the global structure feature of complex networks. To improve the robustness, we select ℓ2;1 norm instead of the widely used Frobenius norm to construct its NMFbased community discovery model. In addition, to improve the scalability, we implement its key components by using MapReduce distributed computing framework, including computing SimRank feature matrix and iteratively solving the NMF-based model for community discovery. We conduct extensive experiments on several typical complex networks. The results show that our method has better performance and robustness than other representative NMF-based methods for community discovery. Moreover, our method presents good scalability, and hence can be used to discover communities in the largescale complex networks.","School of Computing, Electronics and Maths"

This problem has been addressed in this paper by suggesting a system that combines two methods, both of which provide a reduced training requirement for user authentication using free-text keystrokes.  The two methods were fused to achieve error rates lower than those produced by each method separately. Two fusion schemes, namely: decision-level fusion and feature-level fusion, were applied. Feature-level fusion was done by concatenating two sets of features before the learning stage. The two sets of features were: a timing feature set and a non-conventional feature set. Moreover, decision-level fusion was used to merge the output of two methods using majority voting. One is Support Vector Machines (SVMs) together with Ant Colony Optimization (ACO) feature selection and the other is decision trees (DTs). Even though the classifiers using the parameters merged at feature level produced low error rates, its results were outperformed by the results achieved by the decision-level fusion scheme. Decision-level fusion was employed to achieve the best performance of 0.00% False Accept Rate (FAR) and 0.00% False Reject Rate (FRR).","School of Computing, Electronics and Maths"

Network administrators do not have much power to control and mon- itor their networks. Therefore, a new network architecture, so-called software-defined net- working (SDN), has emerged to address these challenging issues by redefining the network to make it programmable. SDN relies on decoupling the control plane from the data plane so that it is central and programmable. OpenFlow protocol, which is an open source proto- col adopted by the Open Networking Foundation, is empowered to facilitate the communi- cation between controller and switch and to enable agile management of the network. However, OpenFlow-based SDN has two shortcomings that affect the network’s perfor- mance. First, the communication between the controller and the switch introduces further delay in round-trip time (RTT). Second, the RTT delay results in packet loss or packets ar- riving at the destination out of order. These two major issues are more likely to occur with UDP traffic due to its characteristics. This paper explains the reasons behind these issues, hypothetically discusses some potential solutions and implements the proposed algorithm. The proposed algorithm reduces the number of packets out of order by increasing the hard timeout time of flow entries when the CPU’s usage increases and by gathering statis- tics from the switch more often. During the demonstration of OpenFlow-based SDN, a POX controller and Mininet are used to emulate the infrastructure needed.

We propose a Deep Convolutional Network (CNN) pre-trained as a Deep Stacked Convolutional Autoencoder (SCAE) in a greedy layer-wise unsupervised fashion. The SCAE model learns to encode facial expression images and produce a feature vector with relatively similar illumination, regardless of the luminance level of the input image. Moreover, we propose fine-tuning the stacked shallow autoencoders after each one of these is trained greedily, rather than just at the end, and show that this approach significantly improves the set of illumination invariant features learnt by the SCAE. Finally, we propose the use of a variant rectifier linear unit transfer function that helps the SCAE model reduce or increase the illumination of images with high or low luminance, and show that the lower and upper bounds greatly influence classification performance. The method proposed provides an increase in classification accuracy of 4% on the KDEF dataset and 8% on the CK+ dataset.","School of Computing, Electronics and Maths"

The development of real time emotion recognition will further improve the relationship between humans and social robots. However, contemporary real time emotion recognition in unconstrained environments has yet to reach the accuracy levels achieved on controlled static datasets. In this work, we propose a Deep Convolutional Neural Network (CNN), pre-trained as a Stacked Convolutional Autoencoder (SCAE) in a greedy layer-wise unsupervised manner, for emotion recognition from facial expression images taken by a NAO robot. The SCAE model is trained to learn an illumination invariant down-sampled feature vector. The weights of the encoder element are then used to initialize the CNN model, which is fine-tuned for classification. We train the model on a corpus composed of gamma corrected versions of the CK+, JAFFE, FEEDTUM and KDEF datasets. The emotion recognition model produces a state-of-the-art accuracy rate of 99.14% on this corpus. We also show that the proposed training approach significantly improves the CNN’s generalisation ability by over 30% on nonuniform data collected with the NAO robot in unconstrained environments.","School of Computing, Electronics and Maths"

Some studies in the field primarily focus on a corrective action to reduce the impact of an already committed crime. However, there are existing computational techniques which can assist in predicting and therefore preventing cyber-crimes.

However, depending on a stale/invalid route to recover from a broken link could increase the delay to recover from,the broken link and degrade the network performance. In this paper, we propose a new MAC protocol (RIVC-MB) to enhance communication reliability in the multipath multichannel routing protocol. The reliability of transmitting/re-routing the data packet in multipath multichannel routing protocol is improved by providing early route invalidity detection and early switchover. Waiting time to access the medium is also improved, when a node is attempting to access a busy medium, by re-routing the data packet via the alternative route. The RIVC-MB protocol uses the cross-layer interaction between MAC and routing protocols to achieve these goals. The proposed protocol is implemented and extensively evaluated using the NS-2 simulator. Simulation results show that the new proposed protocol improves the endto- end delay, and reduces both the number of route error control packets and the number of dropped data packets in the routing layer. It also reduces reduces the collision rate in the MAC layer in a dense network.","School of Computing, Electronics and Maths"

Yusupov, Arfan Ghani",Characterising lateral capacitance of MNOSFET with localised trapped charge in nitride layer,"This paper discusses the limitations of scanning microscope to read localised charge and proposes a viable solution. A 2D simulation and characterisation of the capacitance-voltage (C-V) characteristics of the lateral source-base transition of metal-nitride-oxide-semiconductor field effect transistor (MNOSFET) with charge trapped in nitride layer is presented. It is shown that C-V dependence is changed after trapping the localised charge in nitride layer. The change depends on position of the localised trapped charge. An n-channel transistor is considered with acceptor concentration in base of 1016 cm−3. By localising a charge bit with linear size of 80 nm in nitride layer, it is observed that capacitance jump in C-V dependence starts at some bias voltage applied to the source-base transition. This voltage depends on the position of charge bit. This dependence can be used in determining the charge bit position in the nitride layer along channel. To the best of the author’s knowledge, it is one of the most efficient methods in scanning localised charge.","School of Computing, Electronics and Maths"

A recently completed European project on Smart collaboration between Humans and ground-aErial Robots for imProving rescuing activities in Alpine environments (SHERPA) has proposed a novel collaborative approach to improve the rescuing activities. To be an integral part of the SHERPA framework, this paper considers deployment of an air-ground collaborative wireless network (AGCWN) to support search and rescue (SAR) missions in hostile alpine environments. We propose a network infrastructure for such challenging environments by considering the available network components, hostility of the environments, scenarios, and requirements. The proposed infrastructure also considers two degrees of quality of service, in terms of high throughput and long coverage range, to enable timely delivery of videos and images of the long patrolled area, which is the key in any searching and rescuing mission. We also incorporate a probabilistic search technique, which is suitable for collaborative search assuming AGCWN infrastructure for sharing information. The effectiveness of the proposed infrastructure and collaborative search technique, referred to as Collab-SAR, is demonstrated via a series of computer simulations. The results confirm the effectiveness of the proposal.","School of Computing, Electronics and Maths"

grouping of similar data – can provide powerful and unique insight into large
and complex data sets, in a fast and computationally efficient manner. While
clustering has been used in a variety of fields (from medical image processing
to economics), its application within atmospheric science has been fairly
limited to date, and the potential benefits of the application of advanced
clustering techniques to climate data (both model output and observations) has
yet to be fully realised. In this paper, we explore the specific application of
clustering to a multi-model climate ensemble. We hypothesise that clustering
techniques can provide (a) a flexible, data-driven method of testing
model–observation agreement and (b) a mechanism with which to identify
model development priorities. We focus our analysis on chemistry–climate model
(CCM) output of tropospheric ozone – an important greenhouse gas – from the
recent Atmospheric Chemistry and Climate Model Intercomparison Project
(ACCMIP). Tropospheric column ozone from the ACCMIP ensemble was clustered
using the Data Density based Clustering (DDC) algorithm. We find that a
multi-model mean (MMM) calculated using members of the most-populous cluster
identified at each location offers a reduction of up to ∼ 20 % in the global absolute mean bias between the
MMM and an observed satellite-based tropospheric ozone climatology, with
respect to a simple, all-model MMM. On a spatial basis, the bias is reduced at ∼ 62 % of all locations, with the largest bias
reductions occurring in the Northern Hemisphere – where ozone concentrations
are relatively large. However, the bias is unchanged at 9 % of all locations and increases at 29 %, particularly in the Southern Hemisphere. The
latter demonstrates that although cluster-based subsampling acts to remove
outlier model data, such data may in fact be closer to observed values in some
locations. We further demonstrate that clustering can provide a viable and
useful framework in which to assess and visualise model spread, offering
insight into geographical areas of agreement among models and a measure of
diversity across an ensemble. Finally, we discuss caveats of the clustering
techniques and note that while we have focused on tropospheric ozone, the
principles underlying the cluster-based MMMs are applicable to other prognostic
variables from climate models.","School of Computing, Electronics and Maths"

Information collected from wireless sensors is distributed and exchanged via wireless nodes and anchors for numerous applications in smart homes and cities, transportation, urban planning and healthcare. However, the unplanned manner in which WSN nodes and anchors are deployed have led to a pell-mell of wireless bursts which limit the capacity and,robustness of WSN’s, whilst also increasing inter-system interference. The work described in this paper presents a novel methodology to disentangle the chaotic radio transmissions in congested wireless signal environments in order to provide a sensing capability. The wireless transmissions are treated as pseudo noise waveforms which eliminates the requirement to extract network  information through signal demodulation or decoding. Instead, we leverage the phase and frequency components of these wireless bursts in conjunction with,cross ambiguity function (CAF) signal processing and a Deep Transfer Network (DTN). Lastly, we use 2.4GHz 802.11 (WiFi) signals to demonstrate experimentally the capability of this technique for human respiration detection (including  hrough a wall), and classifying everyday but complex human motions such as standing, sitting and falling.","School of Computing, Electronics and Maths"

Autonomous vehicles will improve road safety by eliminating human errors. However, not all automotive collisions can be avoided. A strategy needs to be developed in the event when an autonomous vehicle encounters an unavoidable collision. Furthermore, the vehicle will need to take responsibility for the safety of its occupants, as well as any other individuals, who may be affected by the vehicle’s behaviour.,		This paper proposes a control system to assist an autonomous vehicle to make a decision to reduce the risks to occupants potentially involved in highway motorway collisions. Before any decision can be made, the potential collisions need to be assessed for their effects. A quick and numerical method for evaluation of impact of potential collisions was developed. Assessing the Kinetic Energy of the vehicles before and after collisions is proposed as a method to assess the severity of collisions. A simulation model developed calculates the kinetic energy values and recommends an autonomous vehicle the motorway lane to drive into to cause the least severe collision impact. Different scenarios are defined and used to test the simulation model. The results obtained are promising and in line with the decision made by the subject expert.","School of Computing, Electronics and Maths"

This paper proposes a novel system for non-invasive human sensing by analyzing the Doppler information contained in the human reflections of WiFi signal. Doppler information is insensitive to the stationary objects, thus no requirement on scenario-specific calibration that makes it ideal for human sensing. We also introduce the time-frequency domain feature vectors of WiFi Doppler information for the Support Vector Machine (SVM) classifier towards activity event recognition. The proposed methodology is evaluated on a Software Defined Radio (SDR) system together with the experiment of five different events. The results indicate the proposed system is sufficient for indoor context-awareness with 95% overall accuracy in event classification and 84.8% PPV & 93.3% TPR in human presence detection which outperforms the traditional Received Signal Strength (RSS) approach (62.5% PPV and 83.3% TPR).","School of Computing, Electronics and Maths"

Detecting their positions in fluoroscopic X-ray images is important for several clinical applications, for example, motion compensation, co-registration between 2D and 3D imaging modalities and 3D object reconstruction.,Methods: For the generalized framework, a multiscale vessel enhancement filter is first used to enhance the visibility of wire-like structures in the X-ray images. After applying adaptive binarization method, the centerlines of wire-like objects were extracted. Finally, the catheters and guidewires were detected as a smooth path which is reconstructed from centerlines of target wire-like objects. In order to classify electrode catheters which are mainly used in electrophysiology procedures, additional steps were proposed. First, a blob detection method, which is embedded in vessel enhancement filter with no additional computational cost, localizes electrode positions on catheters. Then the type of electrode catheters can be recognized by detecting the number of electrodes and also the shape created by a series of electrodes. Furthermore, for detecting guiding catheters or guidewires, a localized machine learning algorithm is added into the framework to distinguish between target wire objects and other wire-like artifacts. The proposed framework were tested on total 10,624 images which are from 102 image sequences acquired from 63 clinical cases.    ,Results: Detection errors for the coronary sinus (CS) catheter, lasso catheter ring and lasso catheter body are 0.56 ± 0.28 mm, 0.64 ± 0.36 mm and 0.66 ± 0.32 mm, respectively, as well as success rates of 91.4%, 86.3% and 84.8% were achieved. Detection errors for guidewires and guiding catheters are 0.62 ± 0.48 mm and success rates are 83.5%.,Conclusion: The proposed computational framework do not require any user interaction or prior models and it can detect multiple catheters or guidewires simultaneously and in real-time. The accuracy of the proposed framework is sub-mm and the methods are robust toward low-dose X-ray fluoroscopic images, which are mainly used during procedures to maintain low radiation dose.","School of Computing, Electronics and Maths"

Rodrigues, Mohammad S. Obaidat",Bayesian Cooperative Coalition Game as a Service for RFID-Based Secure QoS Management in Mobile Cloud,"In this paper, the problem of maintaining the quality of service with respect to high communication cost, available bandwidth, and security is investigated in a mobile cloud environment. A Bayesian cooperative coalition game is formulated in which learning automata stationed at Radio frequency identification (RFID) readers are assumed as the players. These players form a coalition among themselves using newly defined payoff value function (PVF) based upon the communication cost, network bandwidth, and storage requirements. Each player in the game makes his best efforts to increase his individual PVF for which it selects one of the strategies from the strategy space using the conditional probability. For each action taken by the players, they may get a reward or a penalty from the environment according to which they update their action probability vector. Tags are arranged in acyclic directed graph, and a secure access control algorithm is proposed, which results a complexity of O(log(n)) in comparison with earlier solutions having the complexity of O(n). The proposed scheme is evaluated in comparison with other schemes by extensive simulations using various metrics. The results obtained show that the proposed scheme is effective in maintaining the RFID-based secure data dissemination in the mobile cloud environment. In particular, there is a reduction of 20% in computational time, and overhead generated with an increase of more than 30% in packet delivery ratio.","School of Computing, Electronics and Maths"

It is not only the nature of the fault that makes it important to study, but also the differences observed regarding this fault's effect on the motor's conditions. One of these conditions is the rotor bar breakages at non adjacent positions, which has drawn the attention of researchers due to the false negative diagnostic alarms that may be caused. In this paper, a novel approach is presented aiming to reliably detect this type of fault condition. The proposed method is based on the analysis of specific subcomponents of the stray flux over time. The analysis is implemented on an industrial 1.1 MW industrial induction motor, since large industrial motors make the cases where MCSA might fail due to the weak speed ripple effect and closeness of the fault's sidebands to the fundamental harmonic.

In recent work on models of gene expression, it was shown that a mapping based on partitioning of Poisson arrivals (PPA-mapping) can lead to exact solutions for previously unsolved problems. While the approach can be used in general when the model involves Poisson processes corresponding to creation or degradation, current applications of the method and new results derived using it have been limited to date. In this paper, we present the exact solution of a variation of the two-stage model of gene expression (with time dependent transition rates) describing the arbitrary partitioning of proteins. The methodology proposed makes full use of the PPA-mapping by transforming the original problem into a new process describing the evolution of three biological switches. Based on a succession of transformations, the method leads to a hierarchy of reduced models. We give an integral expression of the time dependent generating function as well as explicit results for the mean, variance, and correlation function. Finally, we discuss how results for time dependent parameters can be extended to the three-stage model and used to make inferences about models with parameter fluctuations induced by hidden stochastic variables.","School of Computing, Electronics and Maths"

Sometimes with little relevant expertise and often in time-critical scenarios, assessing threat, risk and proportionate response based on a mix of official briefings, academic sources, and industry threat reports is a challenge. The imperative of dealing with such issues in a timely fashion presents novel technical and political challenges for policy advisers.

When the blades are adjusted, the area of the patient receiving radiation is reduced or increased. Current fluoroscopy systems allow only for manual collimation by the operator. This can be done from the control panel using buttons or joystick. Nonetheless, manual collimation is time consuming, causes interruption to the clinical work-flow, and is operator dependant. This is because the operator has to first identify a region of interest (RoI), then collimate around the RoI depending on the type of the procedure, work-flow phase, and interventionist‘s preferences. In this work, we propose a learning based framework that can autonomously predict the work-flow phase and localize an object of interest during congenital cardiac interventions (CCI) procedures. In particular, we propose to learn the task of work-flow recognition by using a convolutional neural network model. For training and evaluating our model, 4554 images from 25 clinical cases acquired during Biplane CCI procedures at Evelina,London Children’s Hospital, UK were used.

Various sensor data, such as vibration, cutting force and power data, as well as actual machining parameters, have been collected to support efficient tool condition monitoring and life estimation. The effectiveness of the developed system has been validated via machining cases. The system can be extended to wide manufacturing applications.","School of Computing, Electronics and Maths"

This research presented in this paper addresses this challenge by proposing a new multi-constraint learning path recommendation algorithm based on knowledge map. The main contributions of the paper are as follows. Firstly, two hypotheses on e-learners’ different learning path preferences for four different learning scenarios (initial learning, usual review, pre-exam learning and pre-exam review) are verified through questionnaire-based statistical analysis. Secondly, according to learning behavior characteristics of four types of the learning scenarios, a multi-constraint learning path recommendation model is proposed, in which the variables and their weighted coefficients considers different learning path preferences of the learners in different learning scenarios as well as learning resource organization and fragmented time. Thirdly, based on the proposed model and knowledge map, the design and implementation of a multi-constraint learning path recommendation algorithm is described. Finally, it is shown that the questionnaire results from over 110 e-learners verify the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm and show the similarity between the learners’ self-organized learning paths and the recommended learning paths.,Publisher Statement: NOTICE: this is the author’s version of a work that was accepted for publication in Knowledge-Based Systems.

We show that the retrograde p-well effectively addresses the punchthrough issue, whereas offering a robust control over the gate threshold voltage. Both the punchthrough elimination and the gate threshold voltage control are crucial to high-voltage vertical IGBT architectures and are determined by the limits on the doping concentration and the depth that a conventional p-well implant can have. Without any punchthrough, a 10-kV SiC IGBT consisting of retrograde p-well yields gate threshold voltages in the range of 6-7 V with a gate oxide thickness of 100 nm. Gate oxide thickness is typically restricted to 50-60 nm in SiC IGBTs if a conventional p-well with 1 \times 10^{17} cm
              , is utilized. We further show that the optimized retrograde p-well offers the most optimum switching performance. We propose that such an effective retrograde p-well, which requires low-energy shallow implants and thus key to minimize processing challenges and device development cost, is highly promising for the ultrahigh-voltage (>10 kV) SiC IGBT technology.

The challenge is increased when no underlying model of a system is known, measurement noise is present, and long signals need to be interpreted. In this paper we address these issues with a new non parametric classifier based on topological signatures. Our model learns classes as weighted kernel density estimates (KDEs) over persistent homology diagrams and predicts new trajectory labels using Sinkhorn divergences on the space of diagram KDEs to quantify proximity. We show that this approach accurately discriminates between states of chaotic systems that are close in parameter space, and its performance is robust to noise.","School of Computing, Electronics and Maths"

New software-defined high-level design environments for these chips use general purpose languages such as C++ and OpenCL for hardware and interface generation without the need for register transfer language expertise. These advances in hardware compilers have resulted in significant increases in FPGA design productivity. In this paper, we investigate how to enhance an existing software-defined framework to reduce overheads and enable the utilization of all the available CPU cores in parallel with the FPGA hardware accelerators. Instead of selecting the best processing element for a task and simply offloading onto it, we introduce two schedulers, Dynamic and LogFit, which distribute the tasks among all the resources in an optimal manner. A new platform is created based on interrupts that removes spin-locks and allows the processing cores to sleep when not performing useful work. For a compute-intensive application, we obtained up to 45.56% more throughput and 17.89% less energy consumption when all devices of a Zynq-7000 SoC collaborate in the computation compared against FPGA-only execution.","School of Computing, Electronics and Maths"

Research has illustrated the need for additional ‘sense-making’ information to help households make informed energy-related decisions. This study investigates how household members respond when energy consumption data is integrated with information on indoor environmental conditions (IECs) and coupled with advice on energy saving actions. An integrated system of energy meters and IEC sensors was trialled in 19 predominantly social housing properties in the Midlands (England). Households were provided with a tablet computer and feedback was provided via a dedicated ‘Energy Dashboard’ web-based software application (app). The app was designed in collaboration with the social housing provider to display electricity and gas consumption data as well as data on three IECs: relative humidity, carbon dioxide and temperature. This paper draws on the findings from two rounds of semi-structured interviews with participants. All respondents using the app reported that they made use of the IEC data within the sense-making process, finding temperature and humidity to be useful in linking energy consumption, activities and household conditions. Interpretation of IEC data tended to increase with time as understanding increased. However, different users ‘noticed’, ‘interpreted’ and ‘enacted’ information differently as they integrated this with other sources of information, such as feedback from household members and experiential knowledge. The findings suggest that, whilst incorporating greater contextual information, such as IECs, into feedback displays can help users make sense of domestic energy consumption, the outcomes of the sense-making process will be different for different households. Nevertheless, the provision of such information appears to support householders to make decisions about their energy management that they feel appropriate for their household’s wellbeing needs, within the bounds of their agency.","School of Computing, Electronics and Maths,School of Energy, Construction and Environment"

This approach offers flexibility to describe vehicles locations, speed and direction as well as stationary and non-stationary reflectors which are changing rapidly and continuously. The simulation results demonstrate that the LOS channel component is more affected by the direction of motion than the reflection component, whereas the reflection component is more affected by the relative speed of the vehicles.","School of Computing, Electronics and Maths"

A wide range of research efforts and technologies have been explored to alleviate its impact by monitoring students’ engagement, such as emotion or learning behaviors. However, the current research still lacks multi-dimensional computational measures for analyzing learner’s engagement from the interactions that occur in digital learning environment. In this paper, we propose an integrated framework to identify learning engagement from three facets: affect, behavior and cognitive state, which are conveyed by learner’s facial expressions, eye movement behaviors and the overall performance during short video learning session. To recognize the three states of learners, three channel data is recorded: 1)video/image sequence captured by camera, 2)eye movement information from a non-intrusive and cost-effective eye tracker, 3)click stream data from mouse. Based on these modalities, we designed a multi-channel data fusion strategy to explore course learning performance predictions. We also presented a new method to make the self-reported annotations more reliable without using external observers’ verification. To validate the approach and methods, 46 participants were invited to attend an representative course on-line that consisted of short videos in our designed learning environment. The results demonstrated the effectiveness of the proposed framework and methods in monitoring learning engagement. More importantly, a prototype system was developed to detect learner’s emotional and eye behavioral engagement in real-time, meanwhile, it is able to predict the learning performance of learners after they had completed each short video course.","School of Computing, Electronics and Maths"

Therefore, our analysis is based on the temporal variation of,the pixels in vectorised sequences of several IR frames, which results in a high dimensional feature space and an ”np” problem. Two different sparse analysis strategies are used and compared: Sparse Discriminant Analysis (SDA) and Sparse Principal Component Analysis (SPCA). The extracted sparse features are tested with four widely used classifiers: Support Vector Machines (SVM), Random Forests (RF), K-Nearest Neighbours (KNN) and Logistic Regression (LR). To prove the availability of the sparse features, we also compare the classification results of the noisy data based sparse features and non-sparse based features respectively. The comparison shows the superiority of sparse methods in terms of noise tolerance and accuracy.","School of Computing, Electronics and Maths"

The ADLs considered are: (i) preparing and drinking tea, and (ii) preparing and drinking coffee. Abnormal behaviour identified in the context of these activities can be an indicator of a progressive health problem or the occurrence of a hazardous incident. The approach presented considers the temporal aspect of the sequences of actions that are part of each ADL and that vary between participants. The average and standard deviation for the durations of each action were calculated to define an average time and a range in which a behaviour could be considered as normal for each stage and activity. The Cumulative Distribution Function (CDF) was used to obtain the probabilities of abnormal behaviours related to the early and late completion of activities and stages within an activity. The data analysis show that CDF can provide accurate and reliable results regarding the presence of abnormal behaviour in stages and activities that last over a minute. Finally, this approach could be used to train machine learning algorithms for the abnormal behaviour detection.","School of Computing, Electronics and Maths,School of Mechanical, Aerospace and Automotive Engineering"

Hierarchical regulation analysis is a powerful tool to study this regulation at the metabolic, gene-expression, and signaling levels. It has been widely applied to study steady-state regulation, but analysis of the metabolic dynamics remains challenging because it is difficult to measure time-dependent metabolic flux. Here, we develop a nonparametric method that uses Gaussian processes to accurately infer the dynamics of a metabolic pathway based only on metabolite measurements; from this, we then go on to obtain a dynamical view of the hierarchical regulation processes invoked over time to control the activity in a pathway. Our approach allows us to use hierarchical regulation analysis in a dynamic setting but without the need for explicitly time-dependent flux measurements.","School of Computing, Electronics and Maths"

RNA-seq based transcriptome sequencing has been extensively used for identification of lncRNAs. However, accurate identification of lncRNAs in RNA-seq datasets is crucial for exploring their characteristic functions in the genome as most coding potential computation (CPC) tools fail to accurately identify them in transcriptomic data. Well-known CPC tools such as CPC2, lncScore, CPAT are primarily designed for prediction of lncRNAs based on the GENCODE, NONCODE and CANTATAdb databases. The prediction accuracy of these tools often drops when tested on transcriptomic datasets. This leads to higher false positive results and inaccuracy in the function annotation process. In this study, we present a novel tool, PLIT, for the identification of lncRNAs in plants RNA-seq datasets. PLIT implements a feature selection method based on L1 regularization and iterative Random Forests (iRF) classification for selection of optimal features. Based on sequence and codon-bias features, it classifies the RNA-seq derived FASTA sequences into coding or long non-coding transcripts. Using L1 regularization, 31 optimal features were obtained based on lncRNA and protein-coding transcripts from 8 plant species. The performance of the tool was evaluated on 7 plant RNA-seq datasets using 10-fold cross-validation.

Turbulence can introduce deep fading (20 to 30 dB); as a result, the outage probability increases significantly. In order to mitigate the channel fading, the receiver or transmitter diversities or a combined transmitter and receiver diversity (known as multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) techniques) are often considered along with other techniques such as modulation, temporal and wavelength diversities.

Understanding the intentions of the pedestrian/cyclist enables the self-driving vehicle to take actions to avoid incidents. To make this possible, development of methods/techniques, such as deep learning (DL), for the autonomous vehicle will be explored. For example, the development of pedestrian detection has been significantly advanced using DL approaches, such as; Fast Region-Convolutional Neural Network (R-CNN) , Faster R-CNN and Single Shot Detector (SSD). Although DL has been around for several decades, the hardware to realise the techniques have only recently become viable.

Therefore, ≥10 kV SiC IGBTs are highly promising for Smart Grid and HVDC.","School of Computing, Electronics and Maths"

Under extensive TCAD simulations, we show that in addition to offering a robust control on threshold voltage and
eliminating punch-through, the retrograde is highly effective in terms of reducing the stress on the gate oxide of ultra-high voltage SiC IGBTs. We show that a 10 kV SiC IGBT comprising of the retrograde p-well exhibits a much-reduced peak electric field in the gate oxide when compared with the counterpart comprising of a conventional p-well. Using an optimized retrograde p-well with depth as shallow as 1 µm, the peak electric field in the gate oxide of a 10kV rated SiC IGBT can be reduced to below 2 MV.cm-1 , a prerequisite to achieve a highdegree of reliability in high-voltage power devices. We therefore
propose that the retrograde p-well is highly promising for the development of >10kV SiC IGBTs.

Inevitably, a comparison to the most well-developed polytype of SiC, the 4H-SiC, should exist. It is, therefore, important to develop finite element method techniques and models for accurate device design, analysis, and comparison. It is also needed to perform an exhaustive investigation with scope to identify which family of devices, which voltage class, and for which applications this polytype is best suited. In this paper, we validate the recently developed technology computer-aided design (TCAD) material models for 3C-SiC and those of 4H-SiC with measurements on power diodes. An excellent agreement between measurements and TCAD simulations was obtained. Thereafter, based on this validation, 3C- and 4H-SiC vertical power diodes are assessed to create trade-off maps. Depending on the operation requirements imposed by the application, the developed tradeoff maps set the boundary of the realm for those two polytypes and allows to predict which applications would benefit once electrically graded 3C-SiC becomes available.","School of Computing, Electronics and Maths"

It is acknowledged that decreasing the risk in this domain requires consideration of the technological aspects of information security alongside human aspects. Employees intentionally or unintentionally account for a significant portion of the threats to information assets in organisations. This research presents a novel conceptual framework to mitigate the risk of insiders using deterrence and prevention approaches. Deterrence factors discourage employees from engaging in information security misbehaviour in organisations, and situational crime prevention factors encourage them to prevent information security misconduct. Our findings show that perceived sanctions certainty and severity significantly influence individuals’ attitudes and deter them from information security misconduct. In addition, the output revealed that increasing the effort, risk and reducing the reward (benefits of crime) influence the employees’ attitudes towards prevent information security misbehaviour. However, removing excuses and reducing provocations do not significantly influence individuals’ attitudes towards prevent information security misconduct. Finally, the output of the data analysis also showed that subjective norms, perceived behavioural control and attitude influence individuals’ intentions, and, ultimately, their behaviour towards avoiding information security misbehaviour.

In such systems, transposition errors fundamentally undermine reliability and capacity. Thus, in this paper, we study the impact of transpositions on the system performance. Toward this, we present an analytical expression for the exact bit error probability (BEP) caused by transpositions and derive computationally tractable approximations of the BEP for diffusion-based channels with and without drift. Based on these results, we analyze the BEP when background is not negligible and derive the optimal bit interval that minimizes the BEP.

The subsequent results are then analyzed using design-of-experiments methodology and trend analysis, comparing the rates of capacity evolution at various points in cell lifetime. What was found is that the cell ageing evolved in 3 main phases dependent on the cycling time,duration rather than Ah throughput. In early life, charge current was influential, while in later life depth-of-discharge proved significant. It was also clear, that the factors could not be treated in isolation, with higher order and interaction effects observed. This implies that modeling of cell ageing cannot be uniform across lifetime and must consider the different ageing phases of the cell.","School of Computing, Electronics and Maths"

Design/methodology/approach: The empirical evidence is based on ordinary least squares (OLS), Tobit and quantile regressions. In order to respond to policy concerns on the limited evidence on the consequences of social media in developing countries, the data set is disaggregated into regions and income levels. The decomposition by income levels included: low income, lower middle income, upper middle income and high income. The corresponding regions include: Europe and Central Asia, East Asia and the Pacific, Middle East and North Africa (MENA), Sub-Saharan Africa and Latin America. Findings: From OLS and Tobit regressions, there is a negative relationship between Facebook penetration and crime. However, quantile regressions reveal that the established negative relationship is noticeable exclusively in the 90th crime quantile. Further, when the data set is decomposed into regions and income levels, the negative relationship is evident in the MENA while a positive relationship is confirmed for Sub-Saharan Africa. Policy implications are discussed. Originality/value: Studies on the development outcomes of social media are sparse because of a lack of reliable macroeconomic data on social media. This study primarily complemented three existing studies that have leveraged on a newly available data set on Facebook.","School of Computing, Electronics and Maths"

Welding is one of the most widely used joining processes. Various standards have been developed to regularise welding processes and ensure manufacturing consistency. However, there are many inconsistencies and incoherencies in terms of process categorisation within and across the welding standards. It is imperative to undertake investigations on the limitations and issues of the current welding standards in semantic inconsistency, and then to reveal the inadequacy of text based definitions of welding concepts. To address the issues, in this paper, core domain ontology for joining processes (CDOJP), that can semantically categorise joining processes to reconcile semantic inconsistency, is developed. An ontological approach using Web Ontology Language (OWL) is used to define the ontology. The generic nature of the proposed ontology allows it,to be applicable to various joining processes. The proposed ontology is further consolidated to the welding standards so that semantic inconsistencies in the standards can be effectively resolved. This research is validated in an industrial environment via collaboration with one of the largest aero engine manufacturing companies. The recommendations from this research are useful for the international standards committees to improve the joining and welding standards.","School of Computing, Electronics and Maths"

One characteristic of CPS is the reciprocal feedback loops between physical processes and cyber elements (computation, software and networking), which implies that data stream analytics is one of the core components of CPS. The reasons for this are: (i) it extracts the insights and the knowledge from the data streams generated by various sensors and other monitoring components embedded in the physical systems; (ii) it supports informed decision making; (iii) it enables feedback from the physical processes to the cyber counterparts; (iv) it eventually facilitates the integration of cyber and physical systems. There have been many successful applications of data streams analytics, powered by machine learning techniques, to CPS systems. Thus, it is necessary to have a survey on the particularities of the application of machine learning techniques to the CPS domain. In particular, we explore how machine learning methods should be deployed and integrated in Cloud and Fog architectures for better fulfilment of the requirements of mission criticality and time criticality arising in CPS domains. To the best of our knowledge, this paper is the first to systematically study machine learning techniques for CPS data stream analytics from various perspectives, especially from a perspective that leads to the discussion and guidance of how the CPS machine learning methods should be deployed in a Cloud and Fog architecture.","School of Computing, Electronics and Maths"

However, due to the dynamic conditions of the machine and tooling during machining processes, the relevant diagnosis systems currently adopted in industries are incompetent. To address this issue, this paper presents a novel data-driven diagnosis system for anomalies. In this system, power data for condition monitoring are continuously collected during dynamic machining processes to support online diagnosis analysis. To facilitate the analysis, preprocessing mechanisms have been designed to de-noise, normalize, and align the monitored data. Important features are extracted from the monitored data and thresholds are defined to identify anomalies. Considering the dynamic conditions of the machine and tooling during machining processes, the thresholds used to identify anomalies can vary. Based on historical data, the values of thresholds are optimized using a fruit fly optimization (FFO) algorithm to achieve more accurate detection. Practical case studies were used to validate the system, thereby demonstrating the potential and effectiveness of the system for industrial applications.","School of Computing, Electronics and Maths"

Lack of a unified framework has been identified as the key problem. A canonical model, based on the structure of the papers was proposed for data extraction purposes in SLR. Implemented as a classification problem, traditional machine learning models were used to realize the canonical model. A good accuracy was reported in these traditional models.

We experimented with the NLSAT dataset and the Regular Chains Library CAD function for Maple 2018. For each problem, the variable ordering leading to the shortest computing time was selected as the target class for ML. Features were generated from the polynomial input and used to train the following ML models: k-nearest neighbours (KNN) classifier, multi-layer perceptron (MLP), decision tree (DT) and SVM, as implemented in the Python scikit-learn package.

In the first-level, a variable-threshold dynamic programming algorithm to distribute the power between the energy storage system and the engine is proposed. By adding supercapacitor to form the hybrid energy storage system, and using adaptive low-pass filtering algorithm, the power between the battery and the supercapacitor is distributed. To control the supercapacitor and battery to work within the capacity range, a power limits management module for redistributing the power between the engine, the supercapacitor and the battery is considered. The adaptive low-pass filtering algorithm and power limits management module constitute adaptive power allocation method in the second-level. After that, the rain-flow counting algorithm is applied in this paper to calculate battery aging cost. By using the rain-flow counting algorithm, the battery performances are analyzed, and the results show that the adaptive power allocation method can improve the battery service life by about 54.9% compared with the global dynamic programming algorithm. Considering the initial cost of the supercapacitor, the costs of battery aging, fuel consumption, electricity consumption, and management cost of retired batteries, compared with the global dynamic programming algorithm, the life cycle economy of the vehicle is improved by 12.4% under the proposed method.","School of Computing, Electronics and Maths"

A body of existing research seeks to develop and improve algorithms for crowd simulation, typically with a goal of achieving more realistic behaviours. For applications targeting human interaction however, what is judged as realistic crowd behaviour can be subjective, leading to situations where actual crowd data is not always perceived to be more real than simulation, making it difficult to identify a ground truth. We present a novel method using psychophysics to assess the perceived realism of behavioural features with respect to virtual crowds. In this instance, a focus is given to the grouping dynamics feature, whereby crowd composition in terms of group frequency and density is evaluated through thirty-six conditions based on crowd data captured from three pedestrianised real-world locations. The study, conducted with seventy-eight healthy participants, allowed for the calculation of perceptual thresholds, with configurations identified that appear most real to human viewers.

A majority of the board game interventions focused on education to increase health-related knowledge and behaviors (76%, n = 16). Outcomes evaluated included self-efficacy, attitudes/beliefs, biological health indicators, social functioning, anxiety, and executive functioning, in addition to knowledge and behaviors. Using the Cochrane Collaboration tool for assessing bias, most studies (52%, n = 11) had an unclear risk of bias (33% [n = 7] had a high risk and 14% [n = 3] had a low risk). Statistical tests of publication bias were not significant. A random-effects meta-analysis showed a large average effect of board games on health-related knowledge (d* = 0.82, 95% confidence interval; CI [0.15–1.48]), a small-to-moderate effect on behaviors (d* = 0.33, 95% CI [0.16–0.51]), and a small-to-moderate effect on biological health indicators (d* = 0.37, 95% CI [0.21–0.52]). The findings contribute to the literature on games and gamified approaches in healthcare. Future research efforts should aim for more consistent high scientific standards in their evaluation protocols and reporting methodologies to provide a stronger evidence base.","School of Computing, Electronics and Maths"

Time series mining handles several tasks such as classification, clustering, query-by-content, prediction, and others. Performing data mining tasks on raw time series is inefficient as these data are high-dimensional by nature. Instead, time series are first pre-processed using several techniques before different data mining tasks can be performed on them. In general, there are two main approaches to reduce time series dimensionality; the first is what we call landmark methods. These methods are based on finding characteristic features in the target time series. The second is based on data transformations. These methods transform the time series from the original space into a reduced space, where they can be managed more efficiently. The method we present in this paper applies a third approach, as it projects a time series onto a lower-dimensional space by selecting important points in the time series. The novelty of our method is that these points are not chosen according to a geometric criterion, which is subjective in most cases, but through an optimization process. The other important characteristic of our method is that these important points are selected on a dataset-level and not on a single time series-level. The direct advantage of this strategy is that the distance defined on the low-dimensional space lower bounds the original distance applied to raw data. This enables us to apply the popular GEMINI algorithm. The promising results of our experiments on a wide variety of time series datasets, using different optimizers, and applied to the two major data mining tasks, validate our new method.","School of Computing, Electronics and Maths"

However, the battery aging effects due to the additional operation cycles caused by Vehicle-to-Grid (V2G) service and the concern of the battery degradation are the main reason that keeps the customer from being the named prosumer of the grid. This paper proposes a novel active battery anti-aging V2G scheduling approach. Firstly, to evaluate the battery aging effect in V2G service, the battery degradation phenomenon is quantified by a novel use of rain-flow cycle counting (RCC) algorithm. Then, the V2G scheduling is modeled as a multi-objective optimization problem, in which the minimal battery degradation and grid load fluctuation are designed as the optimization objectives. Finally, a multi-population collaborative mechanism, which is particularly designed for the V2G scheduling problem, is also developed to improve the practicability and performance of the heuristic optimization based V2G scheduling method. The proposed methodologies are verified by numerical analysis, which highlights that the proposed V2G scheduling method can minimize battery charge/discharge cycles by optimizing the time and scale of each V2G participant while providing the same services to the grid as expected.","School of Computing, Electronics and Maths"

Based on the approximation of the weighted sum of lognormal random variables (RVs), we derived a theoretical exact bit error rate (BER) for DCO-OFDM systems with spatial diversity. The simulation results are compared with the analytical prediction, confirming the validity of the analysis.

Gas- and liquid-type responses of the viscosity to temperature are considered, and the disk rotates in both a quiescent and an incident axial flow. Temperature-dependent-viscosity flows are typically found to be less stable than the temperature independent cases, with temperature dependences that produce high wall viscosities yielding the least stable flows. Conversely, increasing the incident axial flow strength produces greater flow stability. Transitional Reynolds numbers for these flows are then approximated through an e
              ,-type analysis and are found to vary in approximate concordance with the critical Reynolds number. Examination of the component energy contributions shows that flow stability is affected exclusively through changes to the mean flow. The results are discussed in the context of chemical vapor deposition reactors.

Following from this, a family of shadowed κ - μ fading models are introduced and classified according to whether the underlying κ - μ fading undergoes single or double shadowing. In total, we discuss three types of single shadowed κ - μ model (denoted Type I to Type III) and three types of double shadowed κ - μ model (denoted Type I to Type III). The taxonomy of the single shadowed Type I - III models is dependent upon whether the fading model assumes that the dominant component, the scattered waves, or both experience shadowing. Although the physical definition of the examined models make no predetermination of the statistics of the shadowing process, for illustrative purposes, two example cases are provided for each type of single shadowed model by assuming that the shadowing is influenced by either a Nakagami- m random variable (RV) or an inverse Nakagami- m RV. It is worth noting that these RVs have been shown to provide an adequate characterization of shadowing in numerous communication scenarios of practical interest. The categorization of the double shadowed Type I - III models is dependent upon whether a) the envelope experiences shadowing of the dominant component, which is preceded (or succeeded) by a secondary round of (multiplicative) shadowing, or b) the dominant and scattered contributions are fluctuated by two independent shadowing processes, or c) the scattered waves of the envelope are subject to shadowing, which is also preceded (or succeeded) by a secondary round of multiplicative shadowing. Similar to the single shadowed models, we provide two example cases for each type of double shadowed model by assuming that the shadowing phenomena are shaped by a Nakagami- m RV, an inverse Nakagami- m RV or their mixture. It is worth highlighting that the double shadowed κ - μ models offer remarkable flexibility as they include the κ - μ , η - μ , and the various types of single shadowed κ - μ distribution as special cases. This property renders them particularly useful for the effective characterization and modeling of the diverse composite fading conditions encountered in communication scenarios in many emerging wireless applications.","School of Computing, Electronics and Maths"

We benefit from the martingale theory and Poisson equations to prove and establish the convergence of the first passage time of reward processes to a zero mean Brownian motion. Necessary conditions to derive the results presented in this article are the existence of variances for sojourn times in each state and second order integrability of reward functions with respect to the distribution of sojourn times.

Due to the virtues of better interpretability and ﬂexibility, matrix factorization based methods for network embedding have received increasing attentions. However, most of them are inadequate to learn more complicated hierarchical features hidden in complex networks because of their mechanisms of single-layer factorization structure. Besides, their original feature matrices used for factorization and their robustness against noises also need to be further improved. To solve these problems, we propose a novel network embedding method named DRNMF (deep robust nonnegative matrix factorization), which is formed by multi-layer NMF learning structure. Meanwhile, DRNMF employs the combination of high-order proximity matrices of the network as the original feature matrix for the factorization. To improve the robustness against noises, we use l2,1 norm to devise the objective function for the DRNMF network embedding model. Effective iterative update rules are derived to resolve the model, and the convergence of these rules is strictly proved. Moreover, we introduce a pre-training strategy to improve the efﬁciency of convergence. Extensive experiments on several benchmarks of complex networks demonstrate that our proposed method DRNMF is effective and has better performance than the state-of-the-art matrix factorization based methods for network embedding.","School of Computing, Electronics and Maths"

The anchoring mode enables the robot to stay in a specific place overcoming external disturbances (e.g. peristalsis) for a better and prolonged observation. The modelling of the legged, hybrid and anchoring modes are presented and analysed. Simulation results show robot propulsions in various modes.

As a consequence, new algorithms and improved implementations in combination with alternative and even purpose-built hardware are often instrumental for conducting meaningful studies of such systems. The ensuing demands regarding hardware availability and code complexity are substantial and sometimes prohibitive. We demonstrate how with a moderate coding effort leaving the overall structure of the simulation code unaltered as compared to a CPU implementation, very significant speed-ups can be achieved from a parallel code on GPU by mainly exploiting the trivial parallelism of the disorder samples and the near-trivial parallelism of the parallel tempering replicas. A combination of this massively parallel implementation with a careful choice of the temperature protocol for parallel tempering as well as efficient cluster updates allows us to equilibrate comparatively large systems with moderate computational resources.

This revolution comes with numerous advantages and viable opportunities that can transform the world of wireless communications for the better. Solid-state LEDs are rapidly replacing the contemporary incandescent and fluorescent lamps. In addition to their high energy efficiency, LEDs are desirable for their low heat generation, long lifespan, and their capability to switch on and off at an extremely high rate. The ability of switching between different levels of luminous intensity at such a rate has enabled the inception of a new communication technology referred to as visible light communication (VLC). With this technology, the LED lamps are additionally being used for data transmission. This paper provides a tutorial and a survey of VLC in terms of the design, development, and evaluation techniques as well as current challenges and their envisioned solutions. The focus of this paper is mainly directed towards an indoor setup. An overview of VLC, theory of illumination, system receivers, system architecture, and ongoing developments are provided. We further provide some baseline simulation results to give a technical background on the performance of VLC systems. Moreover, we provide the potential of incorporating VLC techniques in the current and upcoming technologies such as fifth-generation (5G), beyond fifth-generation (B5G) wireless communication trends including sixth-generation (6G), and intelligent reflective surfaces (IRSs) among others.","School of Computing, Electronics and Maths"

On the basis of the characteristic function (CHF) of GG random variables, we derived an approximated bit-error rate (BER) for the CAP modulation scheme with spatial diversity and equal-gain combining (EGC). Furthermore, we simulated the performance of the CAP system with diversity and LDPC for various turbulence conditions and validated the analysis. Obtained results showed that the combination of LDPC and spatial diversity is effective in mitigating turbulence-induced fading, especially when turbulence strength is strong.","School of Computing, Electronics and Maths"

Given limited resources for HIV prevention, identifying PrEP provision strategies that maximize impact is critical.,METHODS: We used a stochastic individual-based network model to evaluate the direct (infections prevented among PrEP users) and indirect (infections prevented among non-PrEP users as a result of PrEP) benefits of PrEP, the person-years of PrEP required to prevent one HIV infection, and the community-level impact of providing PrEP to populations defined by gender and age in western Kenya and South Africa. We examined sensitivity of results to scale-up of antiretroviral therapy (ART) and voluntary medical male circumcision (VMMC) by comparing two scenarios: maintaining current coverage (""status quo"") and rapid scale-up to meet programmatic targets (""fast-track"").,RESULTS: The community-level impact of PrEP was greatest among women aged 15-24 due to high incidence, while PrEP use among men aged 15-24 yielded the highest proportion of indirect infections prevented in the community. These indirect infections prevented continue to increase over time (western Kenya: 0.4-5.5 (status quo); 0.4-4.9 (fast-track); South Africa: 0.5-1.8 (status quo); 0.5-3.0 (fast-track)) relative to direct infections prevented among PrEP users. The number of person-years of PrEP needed to prevent one HIV infection was lower (59 western Kenya and 69 in South Africa in the status quo scenario; 201 western Kenya and 87 in South Africa in the fast-track scenario) when PrEP was provided only to women compared with only to men over time horizons of up to 5 years, as the indirect benefits of providing PrEP to men accrue in later years.,CONCLUSIONS: Providing PrEP to women aged 15-24 prevents the greatest number of HIV infections per person-year of PrEP, but PrEP provision for young men also provides indirect benefits to women and to the community overall. This finding supports existing policies that prioritize PrEP use for young women, while also illuminating the community-level benefits of PrEP availability for men when resources permit.","School of Computing, Electronics and Maths"

In order to fully benefit from this distributed ledger technology, its limitations, cost, complexity and empowerment also have to be critically appraised. Depending on the specific context of the problem to be solved, these limitations have been handled to some extent through a clear dichotomy in the blockchain architectures, namely by conceiving both permissioned and permissionless blockchains. Permissionless blockchain requires massive computing power to achieve consensus, while its permissioned counterpart is energy efficient but would require trusted participants. To combine these benefits by gaining trust at a high energy efficiency, a novel mechanism is proposed for automatically learning the trust level of users in a public blockchain network and granting them access to a private blockchain network. In this context, machine learning is a very powerful tool capable of automatically learning the trust level. We have proposed reinforcement learning for bridging the dichotomy of blockchains in terms of striking a trust vs complexity trade-off in an unknown environment. Benefits and limitations of various forms of blockchain techniques are analyzed, followed by their reinforcement-aided evolution. We demonstrate that the proposed reinforcement learning aided blockchain is capable of supporting high-integrity autonomous operation and decision making in wireless networks. The win-win amalgamation of these techniques has been demonstrated for striking a compelling balance between the benefits of permissioned and permissionless blockchain networks through the case-study of the proposed blockchain based unmanned aerial vehicle aided wireless networks.","School of Computing, Electronics and Maths"

More complex, dynamic models account for time-dependent changes but are complicated to understand and produce. Under which conditions are static models adequate? We compare static and dynamic model predictions of whether behavioural disinhibition could undermine the impact of HIV pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) provision to female sex workers in South Africa.,METHODS: A static model of HIV risk was developed and adapted into a dynamic model. Both models were used to estimate the possible reduction in condom use, following PrEP introduction, without increasing HIV risk. The results were compared over a 20-year time horizon, in two contexts: at epidemic equilibrium and during an increasing epidemic.,RESULTS: Over time horizons of up to 5 years, the models are consistent. Over longer timeframes, the static model overstates the tolerated reduction in condom use where initial condom use is reasonably high ($\ge$50%) and/or PrEP effectiveness is low ($\le$45%), especially during an increasing epidemic.,CONCLUSIONS: Static models can provide useful deductions to guide policymaking around the introduction of a new HIV intervention over short-medium time horizons of up to 5 years. Over longer timeframes, static models may not sufficiently emphasise situations of programmatic importance, especially where underlying epidemics are still increasing.","School of Computing, Electronics and Maths"

The model also imposes positivity conditions on all variables and parameters. We apply combinations of symbolic computation methods designed for mixed equality / inequality systems, specifically virtual substitution, lazy real triangularization and cylindrical algebraic decomposition, as well as a simplification technique adapted from Gaussian elimination and graph theory. We are able to determine semi-algebraic conditions for multistationarity of our main example over a 2-dimensional parameter space.

We are particularly concerned with computer algebra systems (CASs), and in particular, our experiments are for selecting the variable ordering to use when performing a cylindrical algebraic decomposition of n-dimensional real space with respect to the signs of a set of polynomials.,In our prior work we explored the different ML models that could be used, and how to identify suitable features of the input polynomials.  In the present paper we both repeat our prior experiments on problems which have more variables (and thus exponentially more possible orderings), and examine the metric which our ML classifiers targets.  The natural metric is computational runtime, with classifiers trained to pick the ordering which minimises this.  However, this leads to the situation were models do not distinguish between any of the non-optimal orderings, whose runtimes may still vary dramatically.  In this paper we investigate a modification to the cross-validation algorithms of the classifiers so that they do distinguish these cases, leading to improved results.

This may be due to a variety of reasons. One of the reasons is that a mass of undissolved alumina may get enrobed by the cryolitic bath, and this mix freezes due to the decrease in temperature below the liquidus point. Thus, an electrically resistive solid layer (“mud”) is formed at a part of the cathode. This leads to horizontal electric currents in the liquid aluminum layer, and their magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) interaction with the vertical magnetic field induces a rotating flow of aluminum. This may cause undesirable MHD instabilities. A quasi-two-dimensional model for the laboratory facility has been presented. The results show that the dominating feature of the flow is a depression of the free surface of the liquid metal above the mud spot. This is due to strong rotation of the liquid metal around the mud spot, which causes the centrifugal force. Other effects may include superimposed conventional MHD instability, which manifests itself in a rotating interface, modulated waves, reflection of the waves from the corners of the domain, sloshing, etc. It has been shown that small mud spots do not affect the cell stability, while the large ones may cause such deep depressions that the centrifugal force completely removes the liquid metal above the spot.","School of Computing, Electronics and Maths"

Cuadros",The epidemiological landscape of anemia in women of reproductive age in sub-Saharan Africa,"The role of geographical disparities of health-related risk factors with anemia are poorly documented for women of reproductive age in sub-Saharan Africa (SSA). We aimed to determine the contribution of potential factors and to identify areas at higher risk of anemia for women in reproductive age in SSA. Our study population comprised 27 nationally representative samples of women of reproductive age (15–49) who were enrolled in the Demographic and Health Surveys and conducted between 2010 and 2019 in SSA. Overall, we found a positive association between being anemic and the ecological exposure to malaria incidence [adjusted odds ratio (AOR) = 1.02, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.02–1.02], and HIV prevalence (AOR = 1.01, CI 1.01–1.02). Women currently pregnant or under deworming medication for the last birth had 31% (AOR = 1.31, CI 1.24–1.39) and 5% (AOR = 1.05, CI 1.01–1.10) higher odds of having anemia, respectively. Similarly, women age 25–34 years old with low education, low income and living in urban settings had higher odds of having anemia. In addition, underweight women had 23% higher odds of suffering anemia (AOR = 1.23, CI 1.15–1.31). Females with low levels of education and wealth index were consistently associated with anemia across SSA. Spatial distribution shows increased risk of anemia in Central and Western Africa. Knowledge about the contribution of known major drivers and the spatial distribution of anemia risk can mitigate operational constraints and help to design geographically targeted intervention programs in SSA.","School of Computing, Electronics and Maths"

Using this model, we perform molecular docking and molecular dynamics to examine the interaction of MurM with the phospholipid bilayer and the membrane-embedded Lipid II substrate. Our model suggests that MurM is associated with the major membrane phospholipid cardiolipin, and experimental evidence confirms that the activity of MurM is enhanced by this phospholipid and inhibited by its direct precursor phosphatidylglycerol.

Monte Carlo simulation is used to examine the obtained statistical model for different transmission scenarios. In addition, the Kolmogorov-Smirnov test for the statistical model and Monte Carlo simulation has been performed to verify that they represent the same distribution. The results show that the channel statistical distribution varies with the traffic flow and inter-vehicular spacing, which changes at different times of the day. The results also show that the path loss values of the non-line-of-sight component are significantly larger than the path loss values of the line-of-sight component of the channel when a single reflector is considered.

Taufiq Asyhari,Solving Coupling Security Problem for Sustainable Sensor-Cloud Systems based on Fog Computing,"Modern societies are becoming increasingly reliance on inter-connected digital systems. Despite numerous benefits, it is important to overcome existing security problems in a highly inter-connected system, like Sensor-Cloud systems. Sensor-Cloud is the product of the integration of wireless sensor networks and cloud computing. However, when a physical sensor node receives multiple service commands simultaneously, there will be some service collisions, namely, coupling security problem. This coupling security problem may lead to the failure of sustainable services and the system security threat. In order to solve the problem, sustainable resource management and maximum resource utilization are important. In this paper, we extend the Kuhn-Munkres algorithm based on fog computing to achieve sustainability. To begin with, we design a buffer queue in fog computing layer which will return the result to the cloud layer directly to increase the resource utilization. Then, we extend the Kuhn-Munkres algorithm to get the initial assignments of resources. The last step is to determine whether the initial assigned resources can be further scheduled, which means that we further improve the resource utilization to realize sustainable resource management. The results demonstrate that our method outperforms the traditional scheduling methods, which decreases both of the rounds and computational costs of scheduling by 24.04-57.78 percent and 9.88-31.51 percent, respectively. The experimental evaluations proved that the performance of the proposed fog-based scheme can effectively solve coupling security problem for sustainable Sensor-Cloud systems.","School of Computing, Electronics and Maths"

Critically, the unlicensed sender uses energy harvested from licensed signals, enhancing the overall energy efficiency and maintaining the integrity of licensed communications. To secure messages broadcast by the unlicensed sender against the wire-tapper, full-duplex destinations – unlicensed recipient and licensed receiver – jam the eavesdropper at the same time they receive signals from the unlicensed sender. To this effect, we derive closed-form formulas for the secrecy outage,probability, which then quantify the security performance of both unlicensed and licensed communications for EHOCNs with jamming-assisted full-duplex destinations, namely EHOCNwFD. In addition, optimum operating parameters are established, which can serve as essential design guidelines of such systems.","School of Computing, Electronics and Maths"

Various services using semantic data such as public data integration of smart cities, semantic search, and linked open data are emerging, and services that open and freely use semantic data are also increasing. By using semantic data, it is possible to create a variety of services regardless of platform and resource characteristics. However, despite the many advantages of semantic data, it is not easy to use because it requires a high understanding of semantics such as SPARQL. Therefore, in this paper, we propose a semantic framework for users of,semantic data so that new services can be created without a high understanding of semantics. The semantics framework includes a template-based annotator that supports automatically generating semantic data based on user input and a semantic REST API that allows you to utilize semantic data without understanding SPARQL.","School of Computing, Electronics and Maths"

The findings suggest that the absence of environment general authority’s role, the absence of a clear legal requirement that refers to SER, the shortage of knowledge and awareness, the lack of motivation from the government, fear of change, and the absence of civil society organisations are perceived as the major barriers that hinder the development of SER. These findings contribute to the literature on institutional voids and sustainable development by providing evidence on SER barriers in the context of a developing country. Therefore, it could be useful to corporate regulators and policymakers to mitigate institutional voids to develop a more focussed SER agenda, when considering regulations for the disclosure and sustainable development.

Although TEE provides real-time 3D visualization of heart tissues and blood vessels and has no ionizing radiation, X-ray fluoroscopy still dominates in guidance of cardiac interventions due to TEE having a limited field of view and poor visualization of surgical instruments. Therefore, fusing 3D echo with live X-ray images can provide a better guidance solution. This paper proposes a novel framework for image fusion by detecting the pose of the TEE probe in X-ray images in real-time. The framework does not require any manual initialization. Instead it uses a cascade classifier to compute the position and in-plane rotation angle of the TEE probe. The remaining degrees of freedom are determined by fast marching against a template library. The proposed framework is validated on phantoms and patient data. The target registration error for the phantom was 2.1 mm. In addition, 10 patient datasets, seven of which were acquired from cardiac electrophysiology procedures and three from trans-catheter aortic valve implantation procedures, were used to test the clinical feasibility as well as accuracy. A mean registration error of 2.6 mm was achieved, which is well within typical clinical requirements.","School of Computing, Electronics and Maths"

Simaula is a prototype game designed and used as a virtual practicum for eliciting understandings on how in-game inquiry was appeared to, or experienced by, the participating teachers. Group interviews with 20 secondary education science teachers revealed four qualitatively different ways of experiencing inquiry-based learning through Simaula: (a) as uncovering insights about student’s learning needs, interests and emotions; (b) as generating ideas and concepts for meaningful inquiry; (c) as a set of operations for designing and carrying out scientific research; and (d) as authentic inquiry for enabling knowledge building processes. Seven dimensions of variation have been identified viewed as contextual influences on conceptions of in-game inquiry constituting discernment of: epistemic inquiry-based learning modes; role of teacher; role of student; game-play focus; core mechanics focus; feedback and progress mechanics and game uncertainty. The results illuminated a partial in-game inquiry approach with distinct epistemic modes from developing empathy and meaning making to knowledge construction and knowledge building. The findings also indicated that game design elements played central role in shaping conceptions of in-game inquiry from focusing on rules and logic as means to completing the game’s level to understanding the complexity of core mechanics for developing and transferring in-game inquiry to the real classroom. This insinuates that distinct game design properties may be considered in terms of extending intrinsic in-game inquiry experiences to actual in-class inquiry practice.","School of Computing, Electronics and Maths"

To assess their safe design and robust decision making in response to all possible scenarios, new methods that use a scenario-based testing approach are needed, as testing on public roads in normal traffic would require driving millions of kilometres. We make use of the scenario-based testing approach and propose a method to model simulated scenarios using Gaussian Process based models to predict untested scenario outcomes. This enables us to efficiently determine the performance boundary, where the safe and unsafe scenarios can be evidently distinguished from each other. We present an iterative method that optimises the parameter space of a logical scenario towards the most critical scenarios on this performance boundary. Additionally, we conduct a novel probabilistic sensitivity analysis by efficiently computing several variance-based sensitivity indices using the Gaussian Process models and evaluate the relative importance of the scenario input parameters on the scenario outcome. We critically evaluate and investigate the usefulness of the proposed Gaussian Process based approach as a very efficient surrogate model, which can model the logical scenarios effectively in the presence of uncertainty. The proposed approach is applied on an exemplary logical scenario and shows viability in finding concrete critical scenarios. The reported results, derived from the proposed approach, could pave the way to more efficient testing of automated vehicles and instruct further physical tests on the determined critical scenarios.","School of Computing, Electronics and Maths"

Previous denoising methods based on convolutional neural networks (CNNs) have shown improvements in the quality of low-dose X-ray fluoroscopy images but may compromise clinically important details required by cardiologists. Methods: In order to obtain denoised X-ray fluoroscopy images whilst preserving details, we propose a novel deep-learning-based denoising framework, namely edge-enhancement densenet (EEDN), in which an attention-awareness edge-enhancement module is designed to increase edge sharpness. In this framework, a CNN-based denoiser is first used to generate an initial denoising result. Contours representing edge information are then extracted using an attention block and a group of interacted ultra-dense blocks for edge feature representation. Finally, the initial denoising result and enhanced edges are combined to generate the final X-ray image. The proposed denoising framework was tested on a total of 3262 clinical images taken from 100 low-dose X-ray sequences acquired from 20 patients. The performance was assessed by pairwise voting from five cardiologists as well as quantitative indicators. Furthermore, we evaluated our technique's effect on catheter detection using 416 images containing coronary sinus catheters in order to examine its influence as a pre-processing tool. Results: The average signal-to-noise ratio of X-ray images denoised with EEDN was 24.5, which was 2.2 times higher than that of the original images. The accuracy of catheter detection from EEDN denoised sequences showed no significant difference compared with their original counterparts. Moreover, EEDN received the highest average votes in our clinician assessment when compared to our existing technique and the original images. Conclusion: The proposed deep learning-based framework shows promising capability for denoising interventional X-ray fluoroscopy images. The results from the catheter detection show that the network does not affect the results of such an algorithm when used as a pre-processing step. The extensive qualitative and quantitative evaluations suggest that the network may be of benefit to reduce radiation dose when applied in real time in the catheter laboratory.","School of Computing, Electronics and Maths"

One recent aspect of the efforts to improve reuse rates in buildings is estimating the reusability of the structural elements. This study develops a probabilistic predictive model using advanced supervised machine learning methods to evaluate the economic reusability of the load-bearing building elements. The results of sensitivity analysis and visualization techniques used in this study reveal that the most important economic factor is the need to purchase reused elements early in a project, which could have cash flow implications. The other most important factors are the potential financial risks, the procurement process, and the labour cost. This study unveils that the relationship between variables is not linear, and none of the identified factors could alone determine if an element is reusable or not. This study concludes that the complex interdependencies of factors affecting reuse cause a high level of uncertainty about the feasibility of reusing the load-bearing building structural components from an economic aspect. Nonetheless, this paper reveals that by using the probability theory foundations and combining it with advanced supervised machine learning methods, it is possible to develop tools that could reliably estimate the economic reusability of these elements based on affecting variables. Therefore, the authors suggest utilizing the approach developed in this research to promote the circularity of materials in different subsectors of the construction industry.","School of Computing, Electronics and Maths"

A second one via extraction of the ionic density from simultaneously fitting of the real and imaginary parts of the impedance spectrum by using the Poisson-Nernst-Planck model. The validity of this procedure reposes on the hypothesis that both the diffusion coefficient and the dielectric constant are independent from the salt concentration in the explored range of concentrations.

To coordinate the UAVs located in the sky, also called drones, the concept of the Internet of Drones (IoD) was introduced as overall coordination of UAVs in the sky. IoD paradigm offers a wide range of applications mainly targeting the military and civilian environments. Some of those applications include transportation, agriculture-based systems, entertainment, weather monitoring, healthcare systems, and road hazards monitoring. However, once an area is highly congested by a various number of drones, dynamic or statics obstacles can hinder the overall performance of drones. In order to avoid those obstacles, one of the proposed solutions is to apply collision avoidance techniques while the drones are on duty. In this paper, we present a brief survey of collision avoidance systems for the internet of drones. We have reviewed the current literature review ranging from the year 2010 to 2021. This work has taken into consideration two main frequently used databases in academia: Xplore for IEEE and ScienceDirect for Elsevier.

A detailed discussion and analysis of selected articles were made while most of the techniques used in collision avoidance systems include video-based systems and swarm-based intelligence approaches. Furthermore, the paper discusses the different approaches which are used to design collision avoidance systems.
